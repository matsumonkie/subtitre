You're dead too.

00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,951
I was in a car accident
last month.

23
00:02:36,002 --> 00:02:38,254
I won a swimming trophy
in high school.

24
00:02:38,305 --> 00:02:40,289
Your turn.

25
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,224
I-I ran out
of pain medication.

26
00:02:42,292 --> 00:02:43,959
I got an orbital fracture.

27
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,010
It's just
taking ages to heal.

28
00:02:45,095 --> 00:02:47,129
Take off your shirt.

29
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,181
My eye's up here.

30
00:02:49,266 --> 00:02:50,799
Orbital fracture
means your face

31
00:02:50,851 --> 00:02:52,568
went into the windshield,
which means your chest

32
00:02:52,635 --> 00:02:53,686
went into
the steering wheel.

33
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,988
Painkillers can
suppress heart rate,

34
00:02:56,073 --> 00:02:57,473
so unless you want me
to kill you,

35
00:02:57,524 --> 00:03:00,309
take off your shirt,
let me do a heart exam.

36
00:03:09,619 --> 00:03:11,337
I also wanted to see
the ring of burns

37
00:03:11,421 --> 00:03:15,040
around your collarbone.

38
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,593
How'd you know?

39
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,095
The codeine allergy
you told the nurse about.

40
00:03:19,162 --> 00:03:20,996
That's shorthand for
"give me the strong stuff,"

41
00:03:21,047 --> 00:03:22,798
which matches your
seen-better-days-

42
00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:24,333
because-my-life-
fell-apart suit.

43
00:03:24,384 --> 00:03:25,851
The two old burns
on your fingers

44
00:03:25,936 --> 00:03:27,686
mean you tend to nod off
with a cigarette in your hand.

45
00:03:27,771 --> 00:03:29,555
No reason you shouldn't do that
with one in your mouth.

46
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:33,476
May all your doctors
be stupid.

47
00:03:33,527 --> 00:03:37,363
Hold on a second.

48
00:03:37,447 --> 00:03:41,400
That bruising around
your belly button.

49
00:03:43,954 --> 00:03:45,488
Well, you might get
some fun drugs

50
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:48,691
out of this after all.

51
00:03:48,758 --> 00:03:50,075
Cullen's sign.

52
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,913
But the ultrasound showed air
as well as blood.

53
00:03:53,997 --> 00:03:55,581
Now, I know
what you're thinking.

54
00:03:55,665 --> 00:03:57,199
<i>Hemorrhagic pancreatitis.</i>

55
00:03:57,267 --> 00:03:59,552
But I also know
what I'm thinking.

56
00:03:59,636 --> 00:04:01,870
Doesn't explain
the pneuomoperitoneum.

57
00:04:01,922 --> 00:04:02,888
You took a new case?

58
00:04:02,973 --> 00:04:04,974
You ran tests yourself?

59
00:04:06,726 --> 00:04:08,710
I saw the chance
to help someone in need,

60
00:04:08,762 --> 00:04:11,397
and I instinctively--

61
00:04:11,481 --> 00:04:13,516
oh, no, wait, that was
someone else's instinct.

62
00:04:13,567 --> 00:04:14,900
<i>Wilson is dying.</i>

63
00:04:14,985 --> 00:04:16,051
Your parole officer
is probably

64
00:04:16,102 --> 00:04:17,269
on his way here

65
00:04:17,337 --> 00:04:20,239
How are you possibly
in a good mood?

66
00:04:20,323 --> 00:04:21,991
Did you never see
<i>Dead Poets Society?</i>

67
00:04:22,058 --> 00:04:23,742
<i>Carpe diem.</i>

68
00:04:23,827 --> 00:04:25,411
Air in his abdomen
could mean

69
00:04:25,495 --> 00:04:27,413
blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah.

70
00:04:27,497 --> 00:04:30,399
But blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

71
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,701
Blah. Blah, blah.

72
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:34,270
Nobody cares
about the medicine.

73
00:04:34,337 --> 00:04:35,955
<i>It was perforated ulcer.</i>

74
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:37,239
Laparotomy
to find the hole

75
00:04:37,307 --> 00:04:38,574
in his tummy
and close it up.

76
00:04:38,642 --> 00:04:39,775
You didn't answer
the team's question.

77
00:04:39,843 --> 00:04:41,093
Which is weird,
because normally,

78
00:04:41,161 --> 00:04:42,328
when I talk to
my own employees,

79
00:04:42,395 --> 00:04:44,263
I'm under oath and hooked up
to a lie detector.

80
00:04:44,347 --> 00:04:45,931
You were looking at
six months of prison

81
00:04:45,999 --> 00:04:47,433
instead of five months
of Wilson.

82
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,400
Why happy?

83
00:04:48,468 --> 00:04:49,751
Obviously I had a plan.

84
00:04:49,803 --> 00:04:51,353
Obviously, obviously
you had a plan.

85
00:04:51,421 --> 00:04:52,421
The more
interesting question

86
00:04:52,489 --> 00:04:54,123
is why you didn't
tell the team.

87
00:04:54,191 --> 00:04:55,774
I think it's because part of you
knew from the start

88
00:04:55,842 --> 00:04:57,476
that the plan
wouldn't work.

89
00:05:02,432 --> 00:05:04,617
- I need a meeting.
- I'm busy. Call my office.

90
00:05:04,701 --> 00:05:07,436
Yes...

91
00:05:07,487 --> 00:05:09,071
because wobbly tables

92
00:05:09,122 --> 00:05:10,906
don't just unwobble
themselves.

93
00:05:14,227 --> 00:05:16,128
I need a meeting.

94
00:05:16,213 --> 00:05:17,446
Thanks for fitting me in.

95
00:05:17,497 --> 00:05:20,883
My team has eight urgent,
life-or-death cases

96
00:05:20,951 --> 00:05:21,800
that they've
been waiting for me

97
00:05:21,885 --> 00:05:22,785
to accept or reject.

98
00:05:22,852 --> 00:05:25,954
When is that not true?

99
00:05:26,006 --> 00:05:27,389
Well, right now,
for one.

100
00:05:27,457 --> 00:05:31,977
But tell my parole board
that I'm taking all eight...

101
00:05:32,062 --> 00:05:33,395
that no one else
can crack them,

102
00:05:33,463 --> 00:05:34,813
that you need me here
for the next five months

103
00:05:34,898 --> 00:05:36,798
or eight people will die.

104
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,350
You're asking me
to perjure myself.

105
00:05:38,435 --> 00:05:40,486
It's a tiny, white lie.

106
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:42,104
No offense.

107
00:05:42,155 --> 00:05:43,272
Especially since,
from what I hear,

108
00:05:43,323 --> 00:05:45,524
nothing black is tiny.

109
00:05:45,609 --> 00:05:48,577
Except your penis,
I guess.

110
00:05:48,645 --> 00:05:50,913
You really think I wanted
to cave in that ceiling?

111
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,916
It was a prank
that went wrong.

112
00:05:53,983 --> 00:05:55,167
Dock my pay,
sue me--

113
00:05:55,252 --> 00:05:56,619
Felony vandalism
should have added

114
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:58,070
another year or two
to your sentence.

115
00:05:58,138 --> 00:05:59,371
It's a miracle
the parole board

116
00:05:59,456 --> 00:06:02,625
agreed to six months.

117
00:06:02,676 --> 00:06:06,262
I will go to jail,
eventually.

118
00:06:06,329 --> 00:06:07,829
I will pay the price.

119
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:11,734
I just rather
that Wilson didn't.

120
00:06:11,801 --> 00:06:15,537
Come on,
be a friend.

121
00:06:19,392 --> 00:06:20,893
Okay.

122
00:06:20,977 --> 00:06:24,680
But whatever cases you have,
you have to take them all.

123
00:06:34,824 --> 00:06:37,042
"Be a friend"?

124
00:06:37,127 --> 00:06:38,994
How many fingers
am I holding up?

125
00:06:39,062 --> 00:06:40,663
Of course
you know it's three,

126
00:06:40,714 --> 00:06:42,298
because you know
everything I know.

127
00:06:42,365 --> 00:06:44,667
Everything my smack-addled
brain can remember,

128
00:06:44,718 --> 00:06:47,536
including that
I actually said, "be a friend."

129
00:06:47,587 --> 00:06:49,171
My point wasn't
that you said it.

130
00:06:49,222 --> 00:06:51,557
My point was,
once again, why?

131
00:06:51,641 --> 00:06:52,675
I think it's because
part of you knew

132
00:06:52,726 --> 00:06:53,676
you were gonna need
a friend.

133
00:06:53,727 --> 00:06:55,094
Part of you
knew the plan,

134
00:06:55,178 --> 00:06:58,897
even when it was working,
wouldn't work.

135
00:06:58,982 --> 00:07:00,232
And right now,
I'm curious about

136
00:07:00,317 --> 00:07:01,684
why you're sitting
on the ground

137
00:07:01,735 --> 00:07:04,486
instead of
heading for the door.

138
00:07:09,192 --> 00:07:11,593
Guess we figured out
why you're seeing me,

139
00:07:11,661 --> 00:07:15,497
your suicidal friend.

140
00:07:21,202 --> 00:07:22,285
He'll call you
twice a day.

141
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,047
Then his wife
will call you twice a day

142
00:07:24,131 --> 00:07:26,165
to make sure she understands
what he told her you told him,

143
00:07:26,216 --> 00:07:28,551
which she won't
because he didn't.

144
00:07:29,206 --> 00:07:30,790
Maybe you want to give
this one to Connors.

145
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:33,677
Where's House?

146
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:35,929
Don't know, don't care.

147
00:07:36,013 --> 00:07:39,015
Working.

148
00:07:41,769 --> 00:07:43,603
Excuse me.

149
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,590
No one has seen
or heard from him

150
00:07:47,642 --> 00:07:48,725
since two nights ago.

151
00:07:48,776 --> 00:07:50,310
I'm sure
he's enjoying himself.

152
00:07:50,394 --> 00:07:51,478
Last time
he went to prison,

153
00:07:51,562 --> 00:07:52,779
he maxed out
his credit cards.

154
00:07:52,863 --> 00:07:54,030
Last time
he went to prison,

155
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:57,651
he thought he had
you waiting for him.

156
00:07:57,735 --> 00:08:02,372
You think he could've
done something stupid?

157
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:05,408
I think stupid
is our best-case scenario.

158
00:08:05,476 --> 00:08:08,144
Why do you want
to kill yourself?

159
00:08:08,212 --> 00:08:09,579
Well, here's a reason.

160
00:08:09,647 --> 00:08:12,115
I can't even get stoned
without some annoying jerk

161
00:08:12,183 --> 00:08:15,385
deciding I need
to be deeply analyzed.

162
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,087
Isn't this just

163
00:08:17,154 --> 00:08:19,556
an incredibly simple
calculation?

164
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,291
I'm going to jail,

165
00:08:21,359 --> 00:08:23,660
losing my job,
losing my best friend.

166
00:08:23,728 --> 00:08:25,045
Do I need more?

167
00:08:25,112 --> 00:08:26,846
You think that's
the sum total of who you are?

168
00:08:26,914 --> 00:08:28,982
A doctor?
A friend to Wilson?

169
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,584
I'm also
a tremendous baritone.

170
00:08:31,652 --> 00:08:34,104
Now go away.

171
00:08:34,171 --> 00:08:36,690
Even with your subconscious,
you're evasive.

172
00:08:40,244 --> 00:08:42,662
Death's not interesting.

173
00:08:42,747 --> 00:08:44,748
You exist
for what's interesting.

174
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:47,717
Puzzles, ideas, analysis.

175
00:08:47,785 --> 00:08:51,921
Death is the opposite
of a cool puzzle.

176
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:54,824
It's eternal nothingness.

177
00:08:57,895 --> 00:09:02,565
<i>But you don't find life</i>
<i>interesting anymore.</i>

178
00:09:04,869 --> 00:09:06,803
<i>Stop being an idiot.</i>

179
00:09:10,307 --> 00:09:12,075
Can I have
Kutner back, please?

180
00:09:12,143 --> 00:09:13,610
How much pathetic wallowing
do I have to sit through?

181
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:14,878
How are things in hell?

182
00:09:14,945 --> 00:09:16,813
Is the humidity
the big issue?

183
00:09:16,881 --> 00:09:20,183
What happened next
with the guy's medical case?

184
00:09:20,251 --> 00:09:21,418
Why?

185
00:09:21,485 --> 00:09:23,286
Exactly.

186
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:24,888
Why am I,
meaning you,

187
00:09:24,955 --> 00:09:28,124
<i>still obsessing</i>
<i>about this case?</i>

188
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,359
<i>Obviously we think</i>
<i>it's relevant</i>

189
00:09:29,427 --> 00:09:30,994
to why we're still
sitting on the floor

190
00:09:31,062 --> 00:09:33,129
of a burning building.

191
00:09:36,901 --> 00:09:39,419
There was a code.

192
00:09:39,503 --> 00:09:40,920
Gotta be a clot in his lungs.

193
00:09:41,005 --> 00:09:42,538
We need to get him
to an O.R.

194
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,340
<i>No time.</i>
<i>His O-2 stats are falling.</i>

195
00:09:44,392 --> 00:09:45,975
<i>We have to suck it out here.</i>
<i>Bedside embolectomy.</i>

196
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,543
Float a catheter
through his heart

197
00:09:47,595 --> 00:09:49,262
and his oxygenation
will get even worse.

198
00:09:49,346 --> 00:09:51,514
<i>He'll die before</i>
<i>we can finish the procedure.</i>

199
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,685
House,
we need a call here.

200
00:10:00,191 --> 00:10:02,275
What are you doing?

201
00:10:02,359 --> 00:10:04,944
What did you
give him?

202
00:10:05,029 --> 00:10:07,614
Five, four...

203
00:10:07,698 --> 00:10:11,734
three, two...

204
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:20,093
Naloxone.

205
00:10:20,177 --> 00:10:21,377
<i>We should've</i>
<i>got suspicious</i>

206
00:10:21,429 --> 00:10:22,712
when his visiting cousin

207
00:10:22,763 --> 00:10:25,298
signed in
as "Mr. Tar H. Horse."

208
00:10:25,382 --> 00:10:27,250
<i>Heroin caused</i>
<i>the respiratory distress.</i>

209
00:10:27,301 --> 00:10:29,602
The naloxone
turned off the receptors,

210
00:10:29,687 --> 00:10:31,137
caused your distress.

211
00:10:31,222 --> 00:10:33,306
I'm not gonna stop
doing drugs!

212
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,825
It's reality that sucks!

213
00:10:40,781 --> 00:10:41,948
You're saying
I'm lying...

214
00:10:42,032 --> 00:10:43,817
to my subconscious?

215
00:10:43,901 --> 00:10:44,934
People do it
all the time.

216
00:10:44,985 --> 00:10:46,236
And like it or not,
you are a person.

217
00:10:46,287 --> 00:10:47,937
He said every one
of those things.

218
00:10:47,988 --> 00:10:49,155
But not then
and not like that.

219
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,790
This guy was going nuts
from the naloxone.

220
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,375
He couldn't be rational
if you wanted him to be,

221
00:10:52,442 --> 00:10:53,409
which you did.

222
00:10:53,461 --> 00:10:55,295
Why?

223
00:10:55,379 --> 00:10:56,296
I compressed
the story a little--

224
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,380
Context matters.

225
00:10:57,447 --> 00:10:58,781
You never
talk to patients

226
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,783
for non-diagnostic reasons,

227
00:11:00,835 --> 00:11:03,452
but this guy...

228
00:11:11,762 --> 00:11:14,397
Feeling better?

229
00:11:14,464 --> 00:11:17,267
I'm not gonna stop
doing drugs.

230
00:11:17,334 --> 00:11:19,285
You were a stockbroker.

231
00:11:19,353 --> 00:11:21,271
Son of a stockbroker.

232
00:11:21,322 --> 00:11:24,073
- Married, children.
- <i>I was miserable.</i>

233
00:11:26,327 --> 00:11:28,111
Well, you say
you were miserable

234
00:11:28,162 --> 00:11:31,480
because you need to
rationalize screwing it up.

235
00:11:31,532 --> 00:11:33,700
Except I didn't.

236
00:11:33,784 --> 00:11:37,003
I mean, I-I did.

237
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:41,291
But I'm not miserable.
Not anymore.

238
00:11:43,043 --> 00:11:45,995
I had a ski injury

239
00:11:46,063 --> 00:11:48,497
and painkillers
weren't enough,

240
00:11:48,549 --> 00:11:52,352
and a friend of mine
gave me some heroin.

241
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,390
The second
it entered my veins,

242
00:11:57,474 --> 00:12:03,046
it was like God
had taken over my body.

243
00:12:05,232 --> 00:12:07,817
It was like there
was no more pain

244
00:12:07,868 --> 00:12:11,387
or unhappiness in my life
or anybody else's.

245
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:21,047
But then
you lost everything.

246
00:12:21,131 --> 00:12:23,199
<i>Everything wasn't enough.</i>

247
00:12:25,569 --> 00:12:29,706
Because it's reality
that sucks.

248
00:12:29,773 --> 00:12:33,142
Are you arguing
that he's a good role model?

249
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,211
- He's happy.
- He's dead.

250
00:12:37,348 --> 00:12:38,414
You heard
what you wanted to hear.

251
00:12:38,482 --> 00:12:40,149
The more interesting
question--

252
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:43,219
always--is why
you wanted to hear it.

253
00:12:55,565 --> 00:12:58,368
You're stealing
this guy's oxygen?

254
00:12:58,419 --> 00:13:00,403
There's oxygen
everywhere.

255
00:13:00,454 --> 00:13:01,871
You passed
on all your cases,

256
00:13:01,922 --> 00:13:04,374
reassigned them
to other doctors.

257
00:13:04,425 --> 00:13:07,243
They weren't interesting.

258
00:13:07,294 --> 00:13:09,245
They were my reason for getting
your sentence delayed!

259
00:13:09,296 --> 00:13:10,713
Yeah, well, I guess
you'll have to tell

260
00:13:10,764 --> 00:13:12,432
the parole board
something else.

261
00:13:12,516 --> 00:13:13,850
Maybe that
I was in the O.R.

262
00:13:13,917 --> 00:13:15,251
the entire day
the ceiling collapsed,

263
00:13:15,302 --> 00:13:17,804
so I couldn't have caused
the plumbing problem.

264
00:13:19,974 --> 00:13:21,858
- You set me up.
- Not really.

265
00:13:21,925 --> 00:13:23,810
You were going to
basically perjure yourself

266
00:13:23,894 --> 00:13:25,428
so that I could delay
jail time.

267
00:13:25,479 --> 00:13:27,930
Doesn't it make more sense
to actually perjure yourself

268
00:13:27,982 --> 00:13:31,000
so that I can actually
avoid jail time?

269
00:13:31,068 --> 00:13:34,287
Why are you doing this?

270
00:13:34,371 --> 00:13:36,272
Why are you risking
destroying yourself?

271
00:13:36,323 --> 00:13:38,157
<i>There's no risk.</i>
<i>I know you.</i>

272
00:13:38,242 --> 00:13:40,276
You'll do
the honest thing.

273
00:13:40,327 --> 00:13:42,211
You'll lie.

274
00:13:48,752 --> 00:13:52,555
No.

275
00:14:03,734 --> 00:14:05,735
He's happy.

276
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,270
He's dead.

277
00:14:12,011 --> 00:14:13,645
You weren't worried.

278
00:14:13,922 --> 00:14:16,290
Of course I was worried.
My plan fell through.

279
00:14:16,358 --> 00:14:17,658
The plan didn't matter.

280
00:14:17,726 --> 00:14:20,161
Your plan to replace
that plan didn't matter.

281
00:14:20,228 --> 00:14:22,196
Wilson didn't matter.
Jail didn't matter.

282
00:14:22,247 --> 00:14:24,665
The only thing
that mattered,

283
00:14:24,732 --> 00:14:26,400
the only thing
that <i>ever</i> mattered,

284
00:14:26,451 --> 00:14:28,486
was the puzzle.

285
00:14:34,376 --> 00:14:38,129
I noticed a slight twitch
in his thenar eminence,

286
00:14:38,213 --> 00:14:39,463
which meant...

287
00:14:39,548 --> 00:14:42,483
You're dying.

288
00:14:42,551 --> 00:14:44,268
Because my thumb's
a little shaky?

289
00:14:44,352 --> 00:14:46,353
Plus the thinning
in the muscle,

290
00:14:46,421 --> 00:14:48,472
plus that speech you gave
at Yankee Stadium

291
00:14:48,557 --> 00:14:49,640
saying you were
the luckiest man

292
00:14:49,724 --> 00:14:51,258
on the face
of the earth.

293
00:14:51,309 --> 00:14:55,596
Add them up,
it means ALS.

294
00:14:55,664 --> 00:14:57,631
Lou Gehrig's disease?

295
00:14:57,699 --> 00:14:59,617
You're trapped in your body,
you can't move or speak

296
00:14:59,701 --> 00:15:01,735
while you just die.

297
00:15:01,803 --> 00:15:03,270
If it makes you
feel any better,

298
00:15:03,321 --> 00:15:06,390
at this rate,
it'll be fast.

299
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,015
You're not symmetrical.

300
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:16,116
<i>Wait.</i>

301
00:15:16,184 --> 00:15:17,117
Now you're standing
at the door.

302
00:15:17,169 --> 00:15:18,385
What happened
in the meantime?

303
00:15:18,453 --> 00:15:20,787
And lo, there was
a miraculous wonder--

304
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:22,089
I walked
across the room.

305
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:24,892
No, you just skipped over
a chunk of conversation.

306
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,760
He swore that he would
live a better

307
00:15:26,811 --> 00:15:28,512
and more selfless life
in his remaining time,

308
00:15:28,597 --> 00:15:29,680
blah, blah, blah.

309
00:15:29,764 --> 00:15:31,815
After two blahs,
I'd heard enough.

310
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,799
I moved to the door.

311
00:15:32,851 --> 00:15:36,437
No, you're avoiding it.

312
00:15:36,488 --> 00:15:39,523
Do you smell smoke?

313
00:15:39,608 --> 00:15:41,825
Fair enough.

314
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,978
You're not symmetrical.

315
00:15:46,281 --> 00:15:49,483
The veins on your right side
are distended.

316
00:15:49,534 --> 00:15:50,701
<i>What does that mean?</i>

317
00:15:50,785 --> 00:15:52,786
There's a bulge in
your superclavicular notch.

318
00:15:52,837 --> 00:15:54,622
There's something
in there.

319
00:15:54,673 --> 00:15:56,290
What?

320
00:15:56,341 --> 00:15:58,876
Well, I'm not <i>that</i> good
a doctor.

321
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:15,476
Good news:
Your case is fascinating.

322
00:16:15,527 --> 00:16:17,278
<i>And good news</i>
<i>for you:</i>

323
00:16:17,345 --> 00:16:18,729
You're gonna live.

324
00:16:18,813 --> 00:16:21,982
You've inhaled
a small branch,

325
00:16:22,033 --> 00:16:23,367
probably while
you were realizing

326
00:16:23,451 --> 00:16:25,236
that it's all worth it
while you were passed out

327
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,487
on a park bench.

328
00:16:26,538 --> 00:16:28,289
Anyone else
would have coughed it up,

329
00:16:28,356 --> 00:16:30,908
but 'cause you're a junkie,
your cough reflex is suppressed.

330
00:16:30,992 --> 00:16:32,543
And it grew?

331
00:16:32,627 --> 00:16:34,361
Not unless you also inhaled
a chunk of the sun

332
00:16:34,412 --> 00:16:37,197
and a drip-irrigation system,
you idiot.

333
00:16:37,249 --> 00:16:39,550
It set off an auto-immune
reaction, which--

334
00:16:39,634 --> 00:16:41,402
I can't help saying this--

335
00:16:41,469 --> 00:16:44,204
was the root
of all your problems.

336
00:16:46,374 --> 00:16:50,144
You're smiling.

337
00:16:50,211 --> 00:16:53,981
I was,
and now I'm not

338
00:16:54,049 --> 00:16:55,816
because a moment's fun
a few days ago

339
00:16:55,884 --> 00:16:57,685
does not trump
a friend dying.

340
00:16:57,752 --> 00:16:59,853
Yeah, it does,
you idiot.

341
00:16:59,921 --> 00:17:01,922
'Cause after he's dead,
you cry for a while,

342
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:05,159
and then you go back
to doing what you love.

343
00:17:05,226 --> 00:17:07,494
Every patient
that I've had,

344
00:17:07,562 --> 00:17:08,862
70 years from now,
they'll all be

345
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:11,098
as dead as Wilson.

346
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:14,535
Everybody dies.
It's meaningless.

347
00:17:14,603 --> 00:17:16,570
When you solve a puzzle,
the world makes sense,

348
00:17:16,638 --> 00:17:18,872
and everything
feels right.

349
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,374
And you'll always
have another one,

350
00:17:20,442 --> 00:17:23,043
because people
always get sick.

351
00:17:23,111 --> 00:17:24,878
It's shallow
and it's insignificant,

352
00:17:24,946 --> 00:17:26,947
but if you don't
give a damn if idiots live,

353
00:17:27,015 --> 00:17:29,950
why would you possibly
give a damn about shallowness?

354
00:17:30,018 --> 00:17:33,854
<i>It makes you happy.</i>

355
00:17:33,922 --> 00:17:36,390
<i>And why would you</i>
<i>need more than that?</i>

356
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,976
<i>Go home.</i>

357
00:18:18,633 --> 00:18:21,318
Foreman!

358
00:18:21,403 --> 00:18:24,154
House would never leave food
out here rotting for days.

359
00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:27,574
His suitcases
are in his closet.

360
00:18:29,444 --> 00:18:30,494
If we had handled this
differently--

361
00:18:30,578 --> 00:18:34,748
We did the right thing.

362
00:18:43,091 --> 00:18:46,510
Hello?

363
00:18:46,594 --> 00:18:48,879
I'll let
his accountant know.

364
00:18:48,963 --> 00:18:52,132
House no-showed
on a hooker two nights ago.

365
00:18:52,183 --> 00:18:55,853
Outgoing calls.

366
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,439
Hooker...

367
00:18:58,506 --> 00:19:00,224
me...
I didn't pick up.

368
00:19:00,308 --> 00:19:03,343
Chinese place...

369
00:19:03,395 --> 00:19:04,728
Wait, wait, wait.
Who's that?

370
00:19:04,813 --> 00:19:07,648
He called four times.
I don't know.

371
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:20,893
It's a total disaster.

372
00:20:20,961 --> 00:20:23,351
Do you have any idea
how hard it is

373
00:20:23,354 --> 00:20:24,754
to schedule
a cable appointment

374
00:20:24,822 --> 00:20:26,522
<i>with the hours</i>
<i>that I work?</i>

375
00:20:26,607 --> 00:20:27,857
House has been missing
for two days.

376
00:20:27,942 --> 00:20:29,392
<i>We know</i>
<i>talked to you.</i>

377
00:20:29,476 --> 00:20:30,777
<i>Anything you can tell us</i>
<i>about his mental state,</i>

378
00:20:30,844 --> 00:20:33,012
or where he was headed--
anything at all--

379
00:20:33,063 --> 00:20:34,347
Would be a breach
of confidentiality

380
00:20:34,398 --> 00:20:35,681
and a violation
of the law.

381
00:20:35,733 --> 00:20:40,320
Not if he's a danger
to himself or someone else.

382
00:20:40,371 --> 00:20:41,821
Is this coming out
of our 50 minutes?

383
00:20:41,889 --> 00:20:42,922
Is this your
douche bag group?

384
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:45,858
Excuse me.

385
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,581
What makes you think
he's a danger to himself?

386
00:20:51,665 --> 00:20:53,333
He hasn't been home,
but he didn't

387
00:20:53,384 --> 00:20:56,502
take anything with him,
not even his cell.

388
00:20:56,553 --> 00:20:58,471
You're not saying anything,
which means

389
00:20:58,538 --> 00:21:00,473
he didn't specifically
mention suicide,

390
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,008
but you came out here
to talk to us,

391
00:21:02,076 --> 00:21:06,346
<i>so he must have said</i>
<i>something that worries you.</i>

392
00:21:06,397 --> 00:21:09,349
There are other ways
of reaching oblivion.

393
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,217
- Vicodin?
- He always has his Vicodin.

394
00:21:11,268 --> 00:21:13,453
There's no reason
to call a shr--

395
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,855
his last patient
was a heroin addict.

396
00:21:18,392 --> 00:21:21,194
So I guess
we're all done here.

397
00:21:21,245 --> 00:21:22,996
The guy's address
has gotta be in the file.

398
00:21:27,401 --> 00:21:30,953
<i>What about God?</i>

399
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:32,372
<i>You were leaving,</i>
<i>and then you stopped.</i>

400
00:21:32,423 --> 00:21:34,924
Why?

401
00:21:35,009 --> 00:21:36,092
Your theory
is I'm not leaving,

402
00:21:36,176 --> 00:21:39,045
because I believe in God?

403
00:21:39,096 --> 00:21:41,047
What,
he's calling me home?

404
00:21:41,098 --> 00:21:43,082
Maybe falling through
that floor was a sign.

405
00:21:43,133 --> 00:21:44,984
Maybe that the universe
hates you--something.

406
00:21:47,438 --> 00:21:49,522
<i>You really</i>
<i>don't believe?</i>

407
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:52,225
Really?
Not in some deep crack

408
00:21:52,276 --> 00:21:55,528
of some remote recess of some
dark corner of your mind?

409
00:21:55,595 --> 00:21:58,031
No.

410
00:21:58,098 --> 00:21:59,732
Except that some
deep crack

411
00:21:59,783 --> 00:22:01,868
of some remote recess
of some dark corner

412
00:22:01,935 --> 00:22:03,953
is here telling me--
<i>that's enough.</i>

413
00:22:04,038 --> 00:22:05,321
In a burning building,

414
00:22:05,406 --> 00:22:07,273
facing imminent death,
that's more than enough.

415
00:22:07,324 --> 00:22:10,510
Pascal's wager
is facile.

416
00:22:10,577 --> 00:22:13,279
Saying it's facile
is facile.

417
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:16,782
Why is it wrong?

418
00:22:16,834 --> 00:22:18,451
And don't be logical.
Be desperate.

419
00:22:18,502 --> 00:22:22,455
You gotta have something
to hold on to.

420
00:22:22,506 --> 00:22:24,090
You can't live your life
based on something

421
00:22:24,141 --> 00:22:25,508
you don't believe.

422
00:22:25,592 --> 00:22:26,726
But you can
end your life

423
00:22:26,793 --> 00:22:29,295
based on something
you don't believe?

424
00:22:29,346 --> 00:22:30,629
What about love?

425
00:22:30,681 --> 00:22:32,798
I lived with you
for years.

426
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,767
I know you believe
in love.

427
00:22:38,439 --> 00:22:42,308
Foreman wouldn't help me,

428
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:46,479
which means I need you
to take the fall.

429
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:48,197
You do remember
I'm dying, right?

430
00:22:48,282 --> 00:22:51,517
Which is you will never
spend a day in jail.

431
00:22:51,585 --> 00:22:54,053
Fresh-faced,
cancer-ridden.

432
00:22:54,121 --> 00:22:55,755
It's tough to do both,
but you pull it off.

433
00:22:55,822 --> 00:22:57,540
Your fingerprints are
all over those hockey tickets.

434
00:22:57,624 --> 00:23:00,042
I never admitted
to flushing anything.

435
00:23:00,127 --> 00:23:01,294
My prints make sense

436
00:23:01,345 --> 00:23:03,596
if I gave
those tickets to you

437
00:23:03,664 --> 00:23:04,847
as an incentive
to stay alive.

438
00:23:04,932 --> 00:23:07,433
And I was so angry
that you didn't respect

439
00:23:07,501 --> 00:23:09,552
my dying wishes,
I took thousands of dollars

440
00:23:09,636 --> 00:23:11,938
of season tickets
and flushed them down toilets?

441
00:23:12,005 --> 00:23:14,891
All you have to do
is create reasonable doubt.

442
00:23:14,975 --> 00:23:16,142
Great, what if I do more
than that?

443
00:23:16,193 --> 00:23:17,477
What if I end up
in jail?

444
00:23:17,528 --> 00:23:22,582
Or spending my final months
in endless hearings?

445
00:23:22,649 --> 00:23:27,203
That is a risk
you are willing to take.

446
00:23:27,287 --> 00:23:29,021
I have a reputation.

447
00:23:29,072 --> 00:23:30,523
I have a legacy
that could--

448
00:23:30,574 --> 00:23:34,627
Wilson...

449
00:23:34,694 --> 00:23:37,763
I don't want to lose
this time with you.

450
00:23:47,374 --> 00:23:49,708
Okay.

451
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:54,046
Thanks.

452
00:23:54,097 --> 00:23:56,382
I knew I could
count on you.

453
00:24:01,855 --> 00:24:05,825
Wait! Wait.

454
00:24:05,892 --> 00:24:08,694
You want
the fries back?

455
00:24:10,781 --> 00:24:12,849
I'm not gonna
take the fall.

456
00:24:19,339 --> 00:24:22,258
Don't do this
to me, Wilson.

457
00:24:22,342 --> 00:24:23,676
This is
our only option.

458
00:24:23,743 --> 00:24:25,545
Exactly,
because you overplayed

459
00:24:25,596 --> 00:24:27,346
your hand with Foreman,

460
00:24:27,414 --> 00:24:29,799
because you knew
you had me as a backstop.

461
00:24:29,883 --> 00:24:32,585
Even with me dying,
you just assumed

462
00:24:32,636 --> 00:24:33,486
I'd be here
to bail you out.

463
00:24:33,554 --> 00:24:35,471
Since you're here,

464
00:24:35,556 --> 00:24:36,689
and you are
bailing me out,

465
00:24:36,756 --> 00:24:40,226
seems like
a pretty safe assumption.

466
00:24:40,277 --> 00:24:43,563
Hey!

467
00:24:43,614 --> 00:24:45,615
I won't be here soon.

468
00:24:45,699 --> 00:24:47,266
If I do this,
I'm teaching you

469
00:24:47,317 --> 00:24:49,485
that your bad behavior
will always be rewarded.

470
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:50,769
You need to learn--

471
00:24:50,821 --> 00:24:52,822
How to act
when you're gone?

472
00:24:52,906 --> 00:24:54,156
'Cause if that's
the lesson,

473
00:24:54,241 --> 00:24:55,608
we got a really great
opportunity coming up.

474
00:24:55,659 --> 00:24:56,909
You'll just try
to find someone else,

475
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,128
and it won't work,
and it shouldn't work!

476
00:24:59,213 --> 00:25:01,447
So that's the great wisdom
you're imparting?

477
00:25:01,498 --> 00:25:03,199
That I'll always
be alone?

478
00:25:03,267 --> 00:25:06,719
There's only one person
you can count on.

479
00:25:09,623 --> 00:25:11,374
I thought
there were two.

480
00:25:14,628 --> 00:25:17,346
I need to do this...

481
00:25:17,431 --> 00:25:20,683
for you.

482
00:25:29,276 --> 00:25:30,359
Wilson's right.

483
00:25:30,444 --> 00:25:32,078
<i>He's always right.</i>

484
00:25:32,145 --> 00:25:34,363
<i>He's always been</i>
<i>your good side.</i>

485
00:25:34,448 --> 00:25:37,250
I always wondered
why I photographed so poorly.

486
00:25:37,317 --> 00:25:40,002
And because he's always
played that role,

487
00:25:40,087 --> 00:25:43,422
you've never had to develop
a conscience of your own.

488
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:44,874
People don't change.

489
00:25:44,958 --> 00:25:48,094
Consciences don't
spontaneously develop.

490
00:25:49,846 --> 00:25:52,348
You're wrong, Greg.

491
00:25:52,432 --> 00:25:54,517
Which is...

492
00:25:54,601 --> 00:25:56,435
why you'll be
better off without him.

493
00:25:58,972 --> 00:26:00,839
You've been
looking to him

494
00:26:00,891 --> 00:26:04,694
to find what you have
gotta find within yourself.

495
00:26:07,064 --> 00:26:09,749
Something you <i>can</i> find.

496
00:26:27,551 --> 00:26:31,387
Hold your child.

497
00:26:46,486 --> 00:26:50,189
This is a reason to die.

498
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,524
This is what
my life could've been,

499
00:26:51,575 --> 00:26:53,075
not what it can be.

500
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,193
<i>If it could've been,</i>

501
00:26:54,244 --> 00:26:59,165
you're capable of it now.

502
00:26:59,232 --> 00:27:01,751
You're married.
Cuddy's gone.

503
00:27:01,835 --> 00:27:04,170
We aren't the only two people
who could love you.

504
00:27:14,131 --> 00:27:16,132
Why settle so easily?

505
00:27:20,303 --> 00:27:23,189
These are
just idiotic fantasies...

506
00:27:23,256 --> 00:27:26,025
Greg, don't.

507
00:27:26,092 --> 00:27:29,145
At odds with every
logical bone in my body.

508
00:27:29,229 --> 00:27:30,929
Get up.

509
00:27:30,981 --> 00:27:33,432
You do not
have to die in here!

510
00:27:48,482 --> 00:27:50,666
Is this hell?

511
00:27:50,751 --> 00:27:53,285
An eternity of people
trying to convince me to live?

512
00:27:58,508 --> 00:28:01,794
Who says I'm here
to convince you to live?

513
00:28:07,956 --> 00:28:10,057
You're the last one
I thought would hate me.

514
00:28:10,142 --> 00:28:11,225
I don't hate you.

515
00:28:11,309 --> 00:28:14,011
I love you.

516
00:28:16,198 --> 00:28:17,531
And yet you think
I deserve to die.

517
00:28:17,616 --> 00:28:21,235
But not as a punishment.

518
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:25,072
As a reward.

519
00:28:25,157 --> 00:28:29,126
I think...
you've suffered enough.

520
00:28:29,194 --> 00:28:32,630
You've given enough.

521
00:28:32,697 --> 00:28:37,534
I think you deserve
a chance to just...

522
00:28:37,586 --> 00:28:39,920
give up.

523
00:28:42,641 --> 00:28:43,557
Like Wilson did?

524
00:28:43,642 --> 00:28:46,010
Like Wilson did.

525
00:28:46,061 --> 00:28:48,395
You accepted his choice,
that ending the pain

526
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,883
was better than the pain.

527
00:28:52,934 --> 00:28:55,352
Why can't you
give yourself that gift?

528
00:29:06,832 --> 00:29:09,900
This is the address
House's patient gave?

529
00:29:09,951 --> 00:29:11,702
Everybody lies.

530
00:29:15,507 --> 00:29:19,510
You smell smoke?

531
00:29:38,363 --> 00:29:41,282
Just let go.

532
00:29:41,366 --> 00:29:45,236
Just go to sleep.

533
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:51,325
I had a chance
to avoid this.

534
00:29:51,409 --> 00:29:56,664
You had many chances,
and you blew them all up.

535
00:29:56,748 --> 00:29:59,783
No, this was different.

536
00:29:59,851 --> 00:30:01,335
They're all different,

537
00:30:01,403 --> 00:30:03,354
but the reasons
are all the same.

538
00:30:03,421 --> 00:30:06,023
You're arrogant.
You're self-destructive.

539
00:30:06,091 --> 00:30:09,360
You only care
about yourself.

540
00:30:09,427 --> 00:30:13,664
That moment
with the patient...

541
00:30:13,732 --> 00:30:19,270
the chunk of the conversation
I skipped over...

542
00:30:19,337 --> 00:30:21,305
I told him
he was dying.

543
00:30:21,373 --> 00:30:22,823
If it makes you
feel any better,

544
00:30:22,908 --> 00:30:25,976
at this rate,
it'll be fast.

545
00:30:33,552 --> 00:30:38,289
Let me take the fall.

546
00:30:38,356 --> 00:30:42,159
For you,
for that prank.

547
00:30:44,729 --> 00:30:45,930
You don't
owe me anything.

548
00:30:45,997 --> 00:30:48,299
- You tried to save me.
- I failed.

549
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:50,334
Motives don't matter.
Only actions.

550
00:30:50,385 --> 00:30:52,136
Trying is an action.

551
00:30:52,204 --> 00:30:54,605
Why are you trying
to talk me out of this?

552
00:30:54,673 --> 00:30:56,307
You just fake
the records.

553
00:30:56,374 --> 00:30:59,210
You say I came into
the clinic last week.

554
00:30:59,277 --> 00:31:01,278
I'll tell the cops
you treated me like crap,

555
00:31:01,346 --> 00:31:04,648
so I stole your tickets
and flushed 'em.

556
00:31:10,688 --> 00:31:14,524
Thank you.

557
00:31:25,837 --> 00:31:27,805
And you're doing this
because you're dying?

558
00:31:27,872 --> 00:31:30,207
I'm doing this because
I have nothing left to lose.

559
00:31:34,562 --> 00:31:36,313
So when you were living,
you did nothing for anyone

560
00:31:36,381 --> 00:31:38,015
and you didn't care.
Now that you're dying,

561
00:31:38,066 --> 00:31:41,852
you're willing to help
a virtual stranger.

562
00:31:41,903 --> 00:31:43,887
Which means you're
a better person dying

563
00:31:43,939 --> 00:31:47,057
than you ever were living,

564
00:31:47,108 --> 00:31:48,892
and the world
is a better place

565
00:31:48,944 --> 00:31:54,081
because I didn't
save you.

566
00:31:54,165 --> 00:31:59,253
Which makes me wonder
why I'm about to tell you...

567
00:31:59,337 --> 00:32:01,438
you're not symmetrical.

568
00:32:01,506 --> 00:32:03,207
What's your point?

569
00:32:03,258 --> 00:32:05,960
That you cared about him more
than you cared about yourself?

570
00:32:06,044 --> 00:32:08,128
You cared about the puzzle

571
00:32:08,213 --> 00:32:12,582
more than you cared
about yourself.

572
00:32:12,634 --> 00:32:14,718
If I kept it to myself,

573
00:32:14,769 --> 00:32:17,554
then it would
just be a puzzle,

574
00:32:17,605 --> 00:32:19,306
but I opened my mouth
because I thought it was more.

575
00:32:19,391 --> 00:32:20,391
You know it's the same,

576
00:32:20,442 --> 00:32:21,725
or you wouldn't be
bickering with me

577
00:32:21,776 --> 00:32:22,860
while the flames
lick at your feet.

578
00:32:22,927 --> 00:32:24,812
You're afraid
of this decision,

579
00:32:24,896 --> 00:32:26,063
and you are trying
to argue

580
00:32:26,114 --> 00:32:29,199
until fate takes it
out of your hands.

581
00:32:29,267 --> 00:32:31,702
<i>You're taking</i>
<i>the cowardly way out.</i>

582
00:32:31,769 --> 00:32:35,406
And worse...

583
00:32:35,457 --> 00:32:37,374
you're too cowardly
to even admit

584
00:32:37,442 --> 00:32:39,743
you're taking
the cowardly way out.

585
00:32:46,584 --> 00:32:49,453
You're right.

586
00:32:49,521 --> 00:32:54,174
But I can change.

587
00:34:06,613 --> 00:34:09,115
He could've gotten out.

588
00:34:09,786 --> 00:34:13,466
People are found
sometimes, even in...

589
00:34:13,467 --> 00:34:17,170
collapsed--

590
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,055
I think they're pulling
a body out.

591
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:03,967
Coroner confirms
it's him.

592
00:35:04,051 --> 00:35:06,052
Dental records match.

593
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,872
House hired me
when no one else would.

594
00:35:25,939 --> 00:35:28,658
He got me fired.

595
00:35:28,743 --> 00:35:31,127
He gave me the guts
to get fired.

596
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:33,463
He gave me the courage
to quit.

597
00:35:33,547 --> 00:35:35,165
<i>Gregory was--</i>

598
00:35:35,249 --> 00:35:37,333
he was a good son.

599
00:35:37,418 --> 00:35:41,471
<i>He was a trying boyfriend,</i>

600
00:35:41,555 --> 00:35:45,225
<i>but I...</i>

601
00:35:45,292 --> 00:35:47,894
never stopped loving him.

602
00:35:47,961 --> 00:35:51,314
He was my husband for real.

603
00:35:54,351 --> 00:35:56,135
I couldn't help but love him.

604
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:58,772
He was my boss.

605
00:35:58,839 --> 00:36:01,191
And my employee.

606
00:36:01,275 --> 00:36:05,111
And both times...

607
00:36:05,162 --> 00:36:06,913
I learned from him.

608
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:09,666
<i>He made me a better parent,</i>

609
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,701
whether he meant to
or not.

610
00:36:11,786 --> 00:36:13,002
<i>He was willing to kill me.</i>

611
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:16,956
And I'll always be grateful.

612
00:36:17,007 --> 00:36:19,025
<i>He wasn't always</i>

613
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:20,627
easy to deal with.

614
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,429
But somewhere in there...

615
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:29,168
he knew how to love.

616
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:38,445
He was my friend.

617
00:36:38,512 --> 00:36:40,814
The thing you have to...

618
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,565
remember--

619
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:44,117
the thing you can't forget

620
00:36:44,184 --> 00:36:46,953
is that Gregory House

621
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:49,372
saved lives.

622
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:52,191
He was a healer.

623
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:54,828
And--and in the end...

624
00:37:04,054 --> 00:37:06,789
House was an ass.

625
00:37:08,876 --> 00:37:11,511
<i>He mocked anyone--</i>

626
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:14,147
patients, co-workers,
his dwindling friends--

627
00:37:14,214 --> 00:37:15,565
anyone who didn't measure up

628
00:37:15,649 --> 00:37:17,767
to his insane ideals
of integrity.

629
00:37:17,852 --> 00:37:20,770
<i>He claimed to be on some</i>
<i>heroic quest for truth,</i>

630
00:37:20,855 --> 00:37:23,106
<i>but the truth is,</i>
<i>he was a bitter jerk</i>

631
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,607
<i>who liked making people</i>
<i>miserable.</i>

632
00:37:24,692 --> 00:37:28,161
And he proved that
by dying selfishly,

633
00:37:28,228 --> 00:37:32,532
numbed by narcotics,
without a thought of anyone.

634
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:35,568
A betrayal of everyone
who cared about him.

635
00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:39,706
Phone.

636
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:44,243
A million times
he needed me,

637
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:45,295
and the one time
that I needed him--

638
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,348
Oh, come on.
This is a funeral.

639
00:37:48,415 --> 00:37:51,718
Just get it.

640
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,261
Well, this is embarrassing.

641
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:05,899
Could've sworn
I turned this off.

642
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,818
This isn't my phone.

643
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:41,801
Hi.

644
00:38:45,105 --> 00:38:46,973
How?

645
00:38:48,676 --> 00:38:51,411
I got out of the back
of the building.

646
00:38:53,447 --> 00:38:54,781
The body--

647
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:58,351
Just switched
the dental records.

648
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:08,828
You're destroying
your entire life.

649
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:12,765
You can't go back
from this.

650
00:39:12,833 --> 00:39:15,702
You'll go to jail
for years.

651
00:39:15,769 --> 00:39:18,571
You can never be
a doctor again.

652
00:39:21,475 --> 00:39:25,411
I'm dead, Wilson.

653
00:39:25,479 --> 00:39:28,214
How do you want to spend
your last five months?
