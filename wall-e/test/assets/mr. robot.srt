1
00:00:00,453 --> 00:00:02,922
Dark Army told me stage two is ready.

2
00:00:03,122 --> 00:00:05,357
<i>I know he's dead. I
know this isn't real.</i>

3
00:00:05,458 --> 00:00:08,260
I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

4
00:00:08,295 --> 00:00:09,994
People have been forging paper records.

5
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:11,029
We haven't set up a system

6
00:00:11,064 --> 00:00:12,597
to verify these sorts of claims.

7
00:00:12,632 --> 00:00:15,299
Rebuilding our database
is the only solution

8
00:00:15,334 --> 00:00:16,534
to this problem.

9
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:18,169
Immunity is on the table

10
00:00:18,204 --> 00:00:19,470
in exchange for a name.

11
00:00:19,505 --> 00:00:20,705
That's all I care about.

12
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,640
<i>We have to talk to them.</i>

13
00:00:22,676 --> 00:00:24,375
<i>They can't do this after
what happened last night.</i>

14
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:26,143
<i>What, that some Mexican
restaurant got shot up?</i>

15
00:00:26,179 --> 00:00:27,611
<i>We can't let them get away with this.</i>

16
00:00:27,646 --> 00:00:29,046
They're going to get away with this.

17
00:00:29,081 --> 00:00:30,881
Promise me you'll let
me do the interview.

18
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:32,649
You've been messing with
me for way too long.

19
00:00:32,685 --> 00:00:34,818
<i>It's my birthday gift to you.</i>

20
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:39,923
_

21
00:00:39,992 --> 00:00:41,959
<i>You know, of all the gifts he sent,</i>

22
00:00:41,994 --> 00:00:44,359
this is the greatest we ever received.

23
00:00:44,395 --> 00:00:46,228
I have to know what you're planning.

24
00:00:46,263 --> 00:00:49,732
We were meant to be allies.

25
00:00:49,767 --> 00:00:51,801
We might just want the same thing,

26
00:00:51,836 --> 00:00:53,235
and I need to be involved.

27
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:55,037
I am pretty positive you're dead wrong

28
00:00:55,073 --> 00:00:56,872
about that, my friend.

29
00:00:56,908 --> 00:01:00,609
I don't think there's anything
we could possibly agree on.

30
00:01:06,516 --> 00:01:08,850
Seems you've been very busy lately.

31
00:01:12,188 --> 00:01:14,823
I have to know what you're planning.

32
00:01:14,858 --> 00:01:16,725
We were meant to be allies.

33
00:01:19,194 --> 00:01:21,161
We might just want the same thing,

34
00:01:21,196 --> 00:01:23,330
and I need to be involved.

35
00:01:23,365 --> 00:01:25,065
I'm pretty positive you're dead wrong

36
00:01:25,101 --> 00:01:27,167
about that, my friend.

37
00:01:27,202 --> 00:01:31,438
I don't think there's anything
we could possibly agree on.

38
00:01:31,473 --> 00:01:33,040
I don't know what game you're playing,

39
00:01:33,075 --> 00:01:35,008
but I suggest you cut the bullshit.

40
00:01:35,043 --> 00:01:38,611
If there's nothing else,
I think we're done here.

41
00:01:38,647 --> 00:01:40,279
Aren't you forgetting that I know

42
00:01:40,314 --> 00:01:42,515
your dirty little secret?

43
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:44,684
There are people close to
you that wouldn't be happy

44
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:46,953
if they knew what I know.

45
00:01:52,893 --> 00:01:54,559
We're both too smart to allow pettiness

46
00:01:54,594 --> 00:01:55,694
to dictate our actions.

47
00:01:55,729 --> 00:01:56,895
We're better than that.

48
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:59,464
Weigh the pros and cons.

49
00:01:59,499 --> 00:02:01,432
Do what you need to do.

50
00:02:01,468 --> 00:02:03,735
As soon as the tabulations
are over with,

51
00:02:03,771 --> 00:02:05,470
you'll know that telling
anyone about this

52
00:02:05,505 --> 00:02:07,572
does neither one of us any good.

53
00:02:07,607 --> 00:02:10,107
In fact, you'll realize
that the only thing to do

54
00:02:10,143 --> 00:02:13,510
in your position when it comes to me

55
00:02:13,546 --> 00:02:16,313
is nothing.

56
00:02:24,523 --> 00:02:26,690
Elliot!

57
00:02:31,396 --> 00:02:33,930
I believe in fate.

58
00:02:33,965 --> 00:02:36,365
There's a reason we met.

59
00:02:36,401 --> 00:02:39,803
There's something between us.
I can see it.

60
00:02:41,673 --> 00:02:44,306
You're only seeing
what's in front of you.

61
00:02:48,378 --> 00:02:51,814
You're not seeing what's above you.

62
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:03,791
I don't understand, I...

63
00:03:03,827 --> 00:03:05,026
I want to.

64
00:03:05,061 --> 00:03:06,327
Help me understand.

65
00:03:17,005 --> 00:03:20,573
"So much depends upon a red wheelbarrow

66
00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:23,210
"glazed with rainwater

67
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:26,479
beside the white chickens."

68
00:03:42,396 --> 00:03:46,866
My father used to say that to
me all the time as a child.

69
00:03:46,901 --> 00:03:49,635
It was the only English he knew.

70
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:53,437
Some silly poem.

71
00:03:53,473 --> 00:03:56,074
It meant very much to him.

72
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,748
I use it as a reminder...

73
00:04:03,784 --> 00:04:06,985
a reminder of him

74
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,387
and a reminder of what I
never wanted to become.

Go on.

77
00:06:35,793 --> 00:06:38,627
<i>How is the Dark Army behind this...</i>

78
00:06:38,662 --> 00:06:41,262
<i>whatever this is?</i>

79
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,746
<i>It's one thing to question your mind.</i>

80
00:06:59,781 --> 00:07:02,582
<i>It's another to question
your eyes and ears.</i>

81
00:07:02,617 --> 00:07:05,152
<i>But then again, isn't it all the same,</i>

82
00:07:05,187 --> 00:07:08,621
<i>our senses just mediocre
inputs for our brain?</i>

83
00:07:08,657 --> 00:07:10,757
Come on.

84
00:07:10,792 --> 00:07:12,659
<i>Sure, we rely on them,</i>

85
00:07:12,694 --> 00:07:16,162
<i>trust they accurately portray
the real world around us,</i>

86
00:07:16,197 --> 00:07:18,965
<i>but what if the haunting
truth is, they can't?</i>

87
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,168
<i>That what we perceive isn't
the real world at all</i>

88
00:07:22,203 --> 00:07:25,938
<i>but just our mind's best guess?</i>

89
00:07:25,974 --> 00:07:29,108
<i>That all we really have
is a garbled reality,</i>

90
00:07:29,143 --> 00:07:33,244
<i>a fuzzy picture we will
never truly make out.</i>

91
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,981
So this is where you've been staying?

92
00:07:36,016 --> 00:07:38,816
God, no. We're only operating from here.

93
00:07:38,852 --> 00:07:41,853
Dark Army set this up?

94
00:07:41,888 --> 00:07:44,022
They're our partners. Of
course they set this up...

95
00:07:44,057 --> 00:07:46,124
for us.

96
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:48,526
We needed a discreet place.

97
00:07:48,561 --> 00:07:51,661
Discreet? You're the most
wanted man in the world,

98
00:07:51,697 --> 00:07:53,797
and you're walking around like that.

99
00:07:53,832 --> 00:07:56,833
You really don't remember this, do you?

100
00:07:56,869 --> 00:07:59,436
<i>Because I'm not the one who set this up.</i>

101
00:07:59,472 --> 00:08:01,338
We've been through this already.

102
00:08:01,374 --> 00:08:04,808
<i>It must have been him. Mr. Robot.</i>

103
00:08:09,414 --> 00:08:13,316
Elliot...

104
00:08:13,351 --> 00:08:14,717
I need to know.

105
00:08:14,752 --> 00:08:18,187
Are you able to handle this or not?

106
00:08:18,223 --> 00:08:21,957
You're here under great risk, not
only to me, but to our plan.

107
00:08:21,993 --> 00:08:24,526
And your, um... disposition

108
00:08:24,561 --> 00:08:26,428
is very much concerning me.

109
00:08:28,832 --> 00:08:30,632
Joanna.

110
00:08:37,674 --> 00:08:40,741
Your wife.

111
00:08:40,776 --> 00:08:44,811
She's been looking for you.

112
00:08:44,847 --> 00:08:47,415
I'm doing what's necessary.

113
00:08:54,357 --> 00:08:56,524
Thank goodness they've
given us these UPSes

114
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:58,458
for the power surges.

115
00:09:01,963 --> 00:09:04,097
Ready to look at what we accomplished?

116
00:09:35,228 --> 00:09:37,495
Wanna take your jacket off, hon?

117
00:09:40,133 --> 00:09:41,966
Don't call me hon.

118
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,069
I just meant you have
some blood on there.

119
00:09:45,105 --> 00:09:46,404
I had some too, on my shirt.

120
00:09:46,439 --> 00:09:49,239
I know what's on my fucking jacket.

121
00:09:52,777 --> 00:09:54,144
I'm sorry for the loss of...

122
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:55,612
I invoke my Fifth Amendment privilege

123
00:09:55,647 --> 00:09:57,780
against self-incrimination

124
00:09:57,816 --> 00:10:01,351
and respectfully decline to
answer any of your questions.

125
00:10:02,654 --> 00:10:04,387
I'm not asking a question.

126
00:10:04,423 --> 00:10:06,888
I just wanted to tell you how
sorry I am for the loss...

127
00:10:06,924 --> 00:10:08,324
I invoke my Fifth Amendment privilege

128
00:10:08,359 --> 00:10:09,958
against self-incrimination

129
00:10:09,994 --> 00:10:13,929
and respectfully decline to
answer any of your questions.

130
00:10:13,964 --> 00:10:16,132
I know you guys were close.

131
00:10:17,935 --> 00:10:21,403
I'm sorry you had to lose him.

132
00:10:21,439 --> 00:10:23,238
He was involved in one of the most

133
00:10:23,273 --> 00:10:26,574
notorious hacker rings in the world.

134
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:30,478
Things like this come
with the territory.

135
00:10:30,514 --> 00:10:32,480
I invoke my Fifth Amendment privilege

136
00:10:32,516 --> 00:10:34,482
against self-incrimination
and respectfully...

137
00:10:34,518 --> 00:10:36,451
You keep trying to invoke
the Fifth Amendment,

138
00:10:36,486 --> 00:10:38,953
but there's this thing
called the Patriot Act

139
00:10:38,988 --> 00:10:42,156
that a bunch of people signed into law.

140
00:10:42,191 --> 00:10:44,291
You know what that means?

141
00:10:44,326 --> 00:10:48,662
It means that you are
not on some TV show.

142
00:10:48,697 --> 00:10:51,231
This isn't "Burn Notice."

143
00:10:51,267 --> 00:10:54,568
There are no blue skies
for you out there.

144
00:10:54,603 --> 00:10:56,235
Characters like you

145
00:10:56,271 --> 00:10:58,704
are not welcome here.

146
00:10:58,739 --> 00:11:01,674
As far as anyone's concerned right now,

147
00:11:01,709 --> 00:11:04,377
you're an enemy combatant.

148
00:11:04,412 --> 00:11:07,513
You don't have any rights.

149
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,318
What the fuck do you
want me to tell you?

150
00:11:12,353 --> 00:11:15,253
I meet my boyfriend. We go eat.

151
00:11:15,289 --> 00:11:16,754
He gets shot.

152
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:19,457
End of Q&A.

153
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,197
Give me a sec.

154
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:40,944
You're gonna want to talk to me.

155
00:11:43,382 --> 00:11:45,949
We're not so different.

156
00:11:45,984 --> 00:11:48,951
We're both Jersey girls.

157
00:11:52,724 --> 00:11:55,024
I know it's hard for you
to believe this right now,

158
00:11:55,059 --> 00:11:57,193
but trust me,

159
00:11:57,229 --> 00:12:00,930
by the end of this day, you and
I are gonna be best friends.

160
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:09,528
Of all the gifts you've been sending me,

161
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:11,829
I've got to say,

162
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:21,905
this one got me the wettest.

163
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:33,916
this one got me the wettest.

164
00:12:33,952 --> 00:12:37,119
So... I'm waiting.

165
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:41,524
What?

166
00:12:44,062 --> 00:12:46,862
The phone calls...

167
00:12:46,897 --> 00:12:48,163
the gifts.

168
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:51,734
Make me understand.

169
00:12:53,504 --> 00:12:58,006
I bet you feel all high
and mighty right now.

170
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:00,542
That right?

171
00:13:00,578 --> 00:13:04,011
Do you think you're a
powerful man, Scott?

172
00:13:04,046 --> 00:13:07,648
Do you feel powerful?

173
00:13:07,684 --> 00:13:10,117
I am the CTO

174
00:13:10,152 --> 00:13:11,619
of the largest conglomerate...

175
00:13:11,654 --> 00:13:15,523
I'm not interested in your job title.

176
00:13:15,558 --> 00:13:18,492
I want to understand

177
00:13:18,527 --> 00:13:22,829
what would make a
powerful man like you...

178
00:13:22,865 --> 00:13:25,499
risk everything...

179
00:13:25,534 --> 00:13:28,167
all so he could drive me crazy?

180
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:37,710
What does it matter?

181
00:13:48,689 --> 00:13:50,723
The morning I learned that I was

182
00:13:50,758 --> 00:13:53,658
promoted to CTO,

183
00:13:53,693 --> 00:13:56,193
I get the call.

184
00:13:56,229 --> 00:13:58,730
Price wanted to hold an event that night

185
00:13:58,765 --> 00:14:01,566
to announce my position.

186
00:14:01,601 --> 00:14:03,535
I thought,

187
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:06,237
"I couldn't be any happier."

188
00:14:08,374 --> 00:14:12,208
And then Sharon walked in.

189
00:14:12,244 --> 00:14:13,444
She had made a...

190
00:14:13,479 --> 00:14:18,348
a doctor's visit...

191
00:14:18,383 --> 00:14:20,551
and wanted me to go with her.

192
00:14:20,586 --> 00:14:23,520
She had found out a month ago

193
00:14:23,556 --> 00:14:25,556
she was pregnant.

194
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:35,364
Didn't talk.

195
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:38,300
I didn't know if she was...

196
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:40,803
happy or sad...

197
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:43,305
or if I was happy or sad.

198
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:50,011
But when we first saw that sonogram...

199
00:14:52,616 --> 00:14:55,016
We lit up.

200
00:14:56,419 --> 00:15:00,321
I thought, uh...

201
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:03,791
this is gonna end up being
the best day of my life.

202
00:15:18,272 --> 00:15:21,508
After the funeral, I didn't know why...

203
00:15:21,543 --> 00:15:23,342
I couldn't understand

204
00:15:23,378 --> 00:15:27,547
how I could... gain and
lose everything...

205
00:15:30,184 --> 00:15:33,452
In one fell swoop.

206
00:15:40,561 --> 00:15:43,495
I wanted you to feel what I felt.

207
00:15:45,065 --> 00:15:47,298
I wanted to give you hope

208
00:15:47,334 --> 00:15:49,568
that I could step on!

209
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,510
But I'm sorry.

210
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:34,610
Ohh...

211
00:16:35,713 --> 00:16:37,546
You pussy.

212
00:16:37,582 --> 00:16:39,414
You piece of shit.

213
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:42,684
I hope you rot in hell like your wife.

214
00:16:42,719 --> 00:16:44,552
You're mourning a woman
who, after she found out

215
00:16:44,588 --> 00:16:47,555
she was pregnant, was gonna
fuck my husband's brains out.

216
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:49,390
I'm glad she's dead.

217
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,525
Fuck her and her fetus corpse.

218
00:16:56,633 --> 00:17:00,500
Aah!

219
00:17:02,071 --> 00:17:04,705
No wonder your
wife was gonna cheat on you.

220
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,439
You're weak and pathetic.

221
00:17:06,475 --> 00:17:09,710
That child's lucky to be dead.

222
00:17:26,427 --> 00:17:27,860
No...

223
00:17:29,597 --> 00:17:31,530
Oh, my God.

224
00:17:31,565 --> 00:17:33,932
Oh, my God, what have I done?

225
00:17:33,967 --> 00:17:36,701
Oh, my God.

226
00:17:36,737 --> 00:17:38,870
My God...

227
00:17:49,082 --> 00:17:51,081
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

228
00:17:53,629 --> 00:17:56,027
Vincent had a punctured lung
and a broken collarbone,

229
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:58,723
but the doctors say he's gonna recover.

230
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:00,559
The bad news is, he's gonna be arrested

231
00:18:00,594 --> 00:18:04,529
and put away for a long
time for his stunt in D.C.

232
00:18:04,564 --> 00:18:06,931
God.

233
00:18:06,966 --> 00:18:10,634
Politicians love to
teabag the rest of us.

234
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:12,770
Too bad they can't take the heat.

235
00:18:12,805 --> 00:18:14,972
What your friend did
was domestic terrorism

236
00:18:15,007 --> 00:18:16,074
in the eyes of the law.

237
00:18:16,109 --> 00:18:17,341
Not my friend.

238
00:18:19,644 --> 00:18:22,645
His associates, the ones we arrested,

239
00:18:22,681 --> 00:18:25,148
identified you as the
ringleader of their outfit.

240
00:18:27,086 --> 00:18:28,885
Trust me,

241
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:32,289
I am no leader.

242
00:18:32,324 --> 00:18:34,857
I can barely keep a guy.

243
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,166
Look, Darlene.

244
00:18:47,305 --> 00:18:49,838
I don't really care
what happened in D.C.

245
00:18:49,873 --> 00:18:53,007
In fact, I thought it was kind of funny.

246
00:18:53,042 --> 00:18:56,177
I've never seen Congress move as
fast as they did on that day.

247
00:18:58,348 --> 00:19:00,848
But there are serious
holes in your story.

248
00:19:00,883 --> 00:19:03,718
And I want to work with
you to figure out why.

249
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:15,095
Look.

250
00:19:15,131 --> 00:19:16,997
Babe.

251
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:20,367
I know how this works.

252
00:19:20,402 --> 00:19:22,302
You get close to me,

253
00:19:22,338 --> 00:19:24,304
play the sympathy card,

254
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,305
relate to me...

255
00:19:26,341 --> 00:19:30,309
we're just two crazy,
wacky Jersey girls.

256
00:19:30,345 --> 00:19:32,178
Take advantage that I did lose

257
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:35,848
what probably was the love of my life.

258
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:39,552
And you act like you care.

259
00:19:39,587 --> 00:19:41,487
But that's just it...

260
00:19:41,523 --> 00:19:45,123
an act.

261
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:48,126
Which is sick and twisted.

262
00:19:48,162 --> 00:19:51,563
I'd rather you arrest me
and throw me into jail.

263
00:19:51,598 --> 00:19:55,200
But let's get something straight.

264
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:58,703
You will not get anything out of me.

265
00:19:58,738 --> 00:20:02,306
So why don't you go read your manual

266
00:20:02,341 --> 00:20:04,675
and find the chapter on conniving cunts

267
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,677
that don't give a fuck
about you or your feelings

268
00:20:06,712 --> 00:20:08,912
and then get back to me
with some real tactics?

269
00:20:08,947 --> 00:20:10,914
Otherwise, get me a lawyer.

270
00:20:10,949 --> 00:20:13,250
As far as I'm concerned,

271
00:20:13,286 --> 00:20:15,986
my only statement to you
is that I saw my boyfriend

272
00:20:16,021 --> 00:20:19,255
go brainless last night at dinner.

273
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,424
I ordered the breakfast combo,

274
00:20:21,459 --> 00:20:23,626
and he stole some of my bacon.

275
00:20:26,198 --> 00:20:28,164
If you want any other details,

276
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,200
the answer is suck a dick.

277
00:20:51,121 --> 00:20:53,020
Wait here.

278
00:21:04,867 --> 00:21:06,567
Remember that movie?

279
00:21:06,603 --> 00:21:09,236
I used to love it growing up.

280
00:21:09,271 --> 00:21:11,804
It's not really scary, but gory.

281
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,974
You know how those two things
aren't really the same?

282
00:21:18,313 --> 00:21:20,580
This is the stuff we found
from Cisco's place.

283
00:21:20,616 --> 00:21:22,349
Couldn't find any tapes.

284
00:21:22,384 --> 00:21:24,618
Figured you were smart
enough to destroy them.

285
00:21:24,653 --> 00:21:27,819
We're running fingerprints and DNA.

286
00:21:27,855 --> 00:21:30,322
Soon we're gonna figure out
if those fsociety videos

287
00:21:30,358 --> 00:21:33,292
were filmed using this camera.

288
00:21:33,327 --> 00:21:35,394
If we find your DNA on that stuff...

289
00:21:37,898 --> 00:21:39,931
I don't know...

290
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:41,800
you tell me how that looks.

291
00:21:44,237 --> 00:21:47,138
As far as your fsociety
videos are concerned,

292
00:21:47,173 --> 00:21:49,307
it looks like the one
person that can help you

293
00:21:49,342 --> 00:21:51,509
is fucking dead.

294
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:53,278
As far as I'm concerned,

295
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:56,814
Cisco and I were into
filming some freaky shit.

296
00:21:56,849 --> 00:22:00,350
Is that a matter of
national security too, hon?

297
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:07,991
Then there's this.

298
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:12,529
Remember your buddy, Xander Jones?

299
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:15,198
According to him, you guys
had a sexual relationship.

300
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:19,067
Dude, are you just gonna

301
00:22:19,103 --> 00:22:21,637
slut shame me all day?

302
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,372
Is that really all you got?

303
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:26,074
He also said that you were
the one that stole his gun.

304
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:28,344
Well, I can't prove that, obviously,

305
00:22:28,379 --> 00:22:31,246
because your fingerprints
weren't on his safe.

306
00:22:31,282 --> 00:22:34,582
I figured you'd be crafty
enough to clean up afterward.

307
00:22:36,586 --> 00:22:39,220
What is funny, though,

308
00:22:39,255 --> 00:22:42,557
is that this casing is linked
to the Fun Society arcade.

309
00:22:52,034 --> 00:22:54,668
Darlene...

310
00:22:54,704 --> 00:22:57,771
You sure you still don't
want to talk to me?

311
00:23:11,953 --> 00:23:13,219
What do you think?

312
00:23:16,123 --> 00:23:18,391
<i>They're planning something.</i>

313
00:23:18,426 --> 00:23:21,060
<i>Mr. Robot, Tyrell, Dark
Army, and Whiterose</i>

314
00:23:21,095 --> 00:23:23,295
<i>are in cahoots to plan something big.</i>

315
00:23:23,331 --> 00:23:27,265
<i>And the worst part?
They all think it's me.</i>

316
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,701
<i>They all think I'm the ringleader,</i>

317
00:23:29,737 --> 00:23:31,570
<i>the one in charge,</i>

318
00:23:31,605 --> 00:23:33,972
<i>and I have no idea what it is.</i>

319
00:23:34,007 --> 00:23:36,908
This place is Mount Olympus.

320
00:23:38,479 --> 00:23:40,746
We are prime.

321
00:23:40,781 --> 00:23:43,213
We're ready!

322
00:23:46,419 --> 00:23:48,486
<i>These are blueprints for a building</i>

323
00:23:48,521 --> 00:23:49,953
<i>and a disassembled firmware</i>

324
00:23:49,989 --> 00:23:52,556
<i>for an uninterruptible power supply,</i>

325
00:23:52,592 --> 00:23:56,293
<i>but I can't understand much past that.</i>

326
00:23:56,328 --> 00:23:58,561
<i>I'm not sure what the play is.</i>

327
00:23:58,597 --> 00:24:00,764
<i>I could ask him,</i>

328
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,766
<i>but who am I really asking?</i>

329
00:24:02,801 --> 00:24:05,902
Elliot, look over here.

330
00:24:23,888 --> 00:24:26,021
Paper docs are coming in from all over,

331
00:24:26,056 --> 00:24:29,425
slowly but surely.

332
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,427
<i>The blueprints.</i>

333
00:24:31,462 --> 00:24:33,628
<i>Is that the building?</i>

334
00:24:33,663 --> 00:24:36,196
<i>The offline version?</i>

335
00:24:37,801 --> 00:24:42,102
17 of 71 facilities around
the country so far.

336
00:24:42,138 --> 00:24:43,604
Within the next month,

337
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,808
they'll have all the
paper documents here.

338
00:24:46,843 --> 00:24:49,276
I thought we were gonna have to
deal with multiple facilities,

339
00:24:49,312 --> 00:24:52,111
but they're making it easier for
us by moving it all to one.

340
00:24:52,147 --> 00:24:54,113
<i>This is where the paper
records are going.</i>

341
00:24:54,149 --> 00:24:56,115
<i>They're trying to rebuild the database.</i>

342
00:24:56,151 --> 00:24:58,718
<i>Titles and deeds, the bloodline
of all real property</i>

343
00:24:58,754 --> 00:25:00,454
<i>in this country.</i>

344
00:25:00,489 --> 00:25:02,322
<i>This is how they're surviving the hack.</i>

345
00:25:02,357 --> 00:25:04,157
When our malware executes,

346
00:25:04,192 --> 00:25:05,659
their whole program...

347
00:25:05,694 --> 00:25:08,494
Our malware?

348
00:25:08,529 --> 00:25:10,195
What malware?

349
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:12,197
Oh, you orchestrated it beautifully.

350
00:25:12,232 --> 00:25:14,467
When the hacked firmware...

351
00:25:14,502 --> 00:25:16,502
Designed to override the safety limits

352
00:25:16,537 --> 00:25:19,004
on the UPS devices

353
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:24,075
and overcharge the lead acid
batteries in the battery room...

354
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:26,878
filling the space up with hydrogen gas.

355
00:25:26,913 --> 00:25:31,182
After breaking the fans and
cutting off backup power,

356
00:25:31,217 --> 00:25:32,817
the malicious firmware

357
00:25:32,853 --> 00:25:36,754
repeatedly re-engages the
UPS autotransformer,

358
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:39,924
creating a spark to ignite an explosion.

359
00:25:42,528 --> 00:25:45,328
There are enough batteries to
produce enough hydrogen gas

360
00:25:45,364 --> 00:25:47,063
to level the building.

361
00:25:47,099 --> 00:25:48,866
When you hacked Evil Corp,

362
00:25:48,901 --> 00:25:51,935
you gave us access to the backdoor.

363
00:25:51,971 --> 00:25:54,270
You made it possible
for us to infect them.

364
00:25:54,306 --> 00:25:56,840
<i>I coded the femtocell
malware for Darlene.</i>

365
00:25:56,876 --> 00:25:59,074
<i>But it wasn't supposed to be for this.</i>

366
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:01,878
The conference call leak, I must admit,

367
00:26:01,913 --> 00:26:06,415
was quite cute... a nice distraction.

368
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:08,851
But this...

369
00:26:08,887 --> 00:26:10,352
is for us.

370
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:17,392
All of us.

371
00:26:22,766 --> 00:26:25,466
I'm gonna rip his fuckin' face off!

372
00:26:25,502 --> 00:26:27,636
This fucker thinks he can hurt my girl.

373
00:26:27,671 --> 00:26:29,470
What's his address?

374
00:26:29,506 --> 00:26:31,739
Tell me his address, 'cause
I'm gonna go find him,

375
00:26:31,774 --> 00:26:33,440
and I'm gonna fuckin' kill him.

376
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:38,478
Are you done?

377
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:41,815
If you're serious about punishing him...

378
00:26:41,851 --> 00:26:43,083
I am. I am.

379
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,454
Just tell me what to do,
and I'll fuckin' do it.

380
00:26:47,489 --> 00:26:49,255
I'll do it.

381
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:50,590
No questions asked.

382
00:26:50,625 --> 00:26:52,124
- Just...
- Shh.

383
00:26:54,663 --> 00:26:58,097
If you are serious about punishing him,

384
00:26:58,132 --> 00:27:01,568
then you can do one thing for me.

385
00:27:01,603 --> 00:27:03,302
What? Anything. Say the word.

386
00:27:07,507 --> 00:27:09,474
You remember the night we met

387
00:27:09,509 --> 00:27:12,010
at the E Corp party?

388
00:27:12,046 --> 00:27:14,813
Yeah.

389
00:27:14,848 --> 00:27:16,414
You were tending the bar that night.

390
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:20,085
You stayed late to clean up.

391
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,120
Yeah, that's what we
always do after the...

392
00:27:22,155 --> 00:27:24,021
Then you saw Scott

393
00:27:24,057 --> 00:27:27,658
coming down from the stairwell
leading to the roof.

394
00:27:27,694 --> 00:27:32,463
He was disheveled, out
of breath, sweaty.

395
00:27:34,033 --> 00:27:38,268
You were about to ask him
if he needed anything,

396
00:27:38,304 --> 00:27:43,372
but he was in such a hurry, he
left without saying a word.

397
00:27:43,408 --> 00:27:44,808
What are you talking about?

398
00:27:44,843 --> 00:27:47,143
I didn't see anything like that.

399
00:27:47,178 --> 00:27:51,014
Yes, you did.

400
00:27:51,049 --> 00:27:53,549
No.

401
00:27:53,585 --> 00:27:56,619
I remember because the cops
were asking every one of us

402
00:27:56,654 --> 00:28:00,288
questions about that night,
and like I told them...

403
00:28:00,324 --> 00:28:02,357
cleaned up my station, and I went home.

404
00:28:02,392 --> 00:28:05,160
Derek, you said you were
serious about punishing him.

405
00:28:05,195 --> 00:28:07,730
Yeah, but Joanna...

406
00:28:07,765 --> 00:28:10,232
Look at my face, Derek.

407
00:28:10,267 --> 00:28:11,834
You want the man that did this to me

408
00:28:11,869 --> 00:28:14,002
to do what he did and get away with it?

409
00:28:14,037 --> 00:28:15,236
But Joanna, I...

410
00:28:15,271 --> 00:28:17,705
Once you tell the cops your story,

411
00:28:17,741 --> 00:28:20,508
they're gonna ask you why
you're just now confessing

412
00:28:20,543 --> 00:28:23,210
after months of silence.

413
00:28:23,246 --> 00:28:26,648
You're gonna tell them
that you were scared...

414
00:28:26,683 --> 00:28:30,251
that Scott Knowles intimidated you.

415
00:28:30,286 --> 00:28:32,318
That when Tyrell went missing,

416
00:28:32,354 --> 00:28:36,556
you didn't think any of
that mattered anymore.

417
00:28:36,591 --> 00:28:39,126
But your conscience got
the better of you.

418
00:28:42,607 --> 00:28:46,275
This is how we win.

419
00:28:46,568 --> 00:28:48,801
This is how we punish him.

420
00:28:50,538 --> 00:28:52,471
You understand?

421
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:57,810
Thank you.

422
00:29:00,108 --> 00:29:02,108
Thank you for protecting me.

423
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:10,421
Of course, babe. I love you.

424
00:29:17,879 --> 00:29:20,412
Now, let's go over it again.

425
00:29:21,575 --> 00:29:24,065
- We can't do this.
- You want us to stay on target?

426
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:27,292
This is the target. This
gets us to the top.

427
00:29:27,926 --> 00:29:29,693
I know we've been operating
under top secret

428
00:29:29,729 --> 00:29:31,862
on this program, but I
think it's worth the risk.

429
00:29:31,897 --> 00:29:33,896
This girl's being a wise-ass.

430
00:29:34,207 --> 00:29:36,041
She thinks she's smarter than we are.

431
00:29:36,076 --> 00:29:39,011
That's because so far she has been.

432
00:29:39,046 --> 00:29:41,212
We got to show her we're smarter.

433
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:43,015
Unless she thinks we're worthy,

434
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:45,417
none of this is gonna fly.

435
00:29:45,452 --> 00:29:47,385
Just trying to sidestep
the mines, like you said.

436
00:29:47,421 --> 00:29:49,521
We've been building this
plan for three months.

437
00:29:49,557 --> 00:29:51,722
Look around you.

438
00:29:51,758 --> 00:29:54,525
All our leads are getting
killed and disappearing.

439
00:29:54,561 --> 00:29:57,028
We've lost three suspects.

440
00:29:57,063 --> 00:29:59,396
Dark Army's cleaning house.

441
00:29:59,432 --> 00:30:02,767
So that must mean something
is about to go down.

442
00:30:02,802 --> 00:30:04,569
Our window is closing.

443
00:30:04,604 --> 00:30:06,604
Every lead we've been
following up to this point

444
00:30:06,639 --> 00:30:08,071
has led to a dead end.

445
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:11,875
Yeah, I'm gonna bring
the ADIC in on this.

446
00:30:11,911 --> 00:30:14,712
Please, you're gonna let
him try and flip her?

447
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:17,213
She's gonna shut down.

448
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:18,682
I'm right for this.

449
00:30:18,717 --> 00:30:21,250
Then I'm gonna go in with you.

450
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:25,153
Let me do it alone.

451
00:30:29,326 --> 00:30:30,659
I know her.

452
00:30:33,397 --> 00:30:34,964
I am her.

453
00:30:38,836 --> 00:30:41,636
And if we're doing this,

454
00:30:41,671 --> 00:30:44,138
we're doing this now.

455
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:05,458
We have 6,332 agents

456
00:31:05,494 --> 00:31:09,062
working on just this case alone.

457
00:31:09,098 --> 00:31:10,731
It's the hardest case
I've ever worked on

458
00:31:10,766 --> 00:31:14,567
and probably the hardest
one I ever will.

459
00:31:14,603 --> 00:31:15,801
Swear to God, the only reason

460
00:31:15,837 --> 00:31:18,037
why I think I've gotten this far...

461
00:31:21,542 --> 00:31:24,744
Is because I have no life.

462
00:31:26,881 --> 00:31:30,449
It's the only thing I've
been able to think about.

463
00:31:30,484 --> 00:31:32,784
Now I'm sitting here with you...

464
00:31:35,022 --> 00:31:36,554
In this awful room.

465
00:31:39,159 --> 00:31:42,761
And no matter what story gets
written in the final analysis,

466
00:31:42,796 --> 00:31:45,697
we've both been a part

467
00:31:45,732 --> 00:31:50,701
of one of the biggest
events in world history.

468
00:31:50,736 --> 00:31:53,303
Believe what you want.

469
00:31:53,338 --> 00:31:56,439
But neither you nor I

470
00:31:56,475 --> 00:31:59,009
are special.

471
00:31:59,045 --> 00:32:01,545
I've already learned that lesson.

472
00:32:09,821 --> 00:32:13,522
If you're open to changing your mind,

473
00:32:13,558 --> 00:32:15,925
I'd like to show you something.

474
00:32:17,729 --> 00:32:19,162
Come with me.

475
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:32,074
You're a lot more
special than you think.

476
00:33:48,414 --> 00:33:53,150
Sure, the strategy was risky, but...

477
00:33:53,185 --> 00:33:55,118
we knew we only had one shot.

478
00:34:00,025 --> 00:34:03,593
If we rounded everyone up, guns blazing,

479
00:34:03,628 --> 00:34:07,930
we thought we would never
get the man in the middle.

480
00:34:07,965 --> 00:34:10,599
And with the stakes being this high,

481
00:34:10,634 --> 00:34:12,101
it was imperative that we got him

482
00:34:12,136 --> 00:34:14,170
before he knew we were getting him.

483
00:34:19,177 --> 00:34:21,277
So we sat back

484
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:24,545
and waited.

485
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,547
They call it the python approach.

486
00:34:28,919 --> 00:34:32,287
They'll lie in wait

487
00:34:32,322 --> 00:34:36,724
for the right moment to strike.

488
00:34:36,759 --> 00:34:41,195
You know some can go up
to a year without eating?

489
00:34:44,033 --> 00:34:46,033
The patient predator.

490
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:54,374
And then Romero's death
made you all scurry.

491
00:34:56,911 --> 00:35:01,214
Funny enough, you thought
Dark Army was involved.

492
00:35:01,249 --> 00:35:04,483
As it turns out, it was
just a stray bullet

493
00:35:04,518 --> 00:35:07,486
from the neighbor next door.

494
00:35:07,521 --> 00:35:09,722
Freak accident.

495
00:36:26,529 --> 00:36:28,662
You've got to be fucking kidding me.

496
00:36:32,279 --> 00:36:33,795
<i>I've tried everything.</i>

497
00:36:33,951 --> 00:36:36,184
<i>I fought him. I OD'd on Adderall.</i>

498
00:36:36,334 --> 00:36:40,137
<i>I made peace with him. I
even got myself arrested.</i>

499
00:36:40,172 --> 00:36:43,740
<i>No matter what I do,
he always finds a way.</i>

500
00:36:43,776 --> 00:36:44,908
<i>Why?</i>

501
00:36:44,943 --> 00:36:46,609
<i>That's all I want to know.</i>

502
00:36:46,645 --> 00:36:50,013
Why is it so important
for you to torment me?

503
00:36:50,049 --> 00:36:53,816
What is it that you care so much about?

504
00:36:53,851 --> 00:36:55,350
What's this all for?

505
00:36:55,386 --> 00:36:56,919
I'm not tormenting you.

506
00:36:56,954 --> 00:36:58,587
After everything you've put me through,

507
00:36:58,622 --> 00:36:59,855
you continue to lie?

508
00:36:59,891 --> 00:37:01,256
I didn't lie to you.

509
00:37:01,292 --> 00:37:02,758
He's alive, man!

510
00:37:02,794 --> 00:37:04,226
He's sitting right fucking there!

511
00:37:06,064 --> 00:37:07,929
You made a plan with the Dark Army.

512
00:37:07,964 --> 00:37:09,164
When was that?

513
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:10,464
The night of the hack?

514
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,667
What is stage two?

515
00:37:12,703 --> 00:37:14,268
The femtocell, the backdoor?

516
00:37:14,304 --> 00:37:16,337
You planned all of that with him?

517
00:37:16,372 --> 00:37:17,605
You can't look at it like this.

518
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,207
You're me. I'm you.

519
00:37:19,242 --> 00:37:20,842
You figured that out.
We're the same guy.

520
00:37:20,877 --> 00:37:22,010
Everything you're blaming me for

521
00:37:22,045 --> 00:37:23,277
you're blaming yourself for.

522
00:37:23,313 --> 00:37:25,112
Stop talking in circles.

523
00:37:25,147 --> 00:37:27,347
You got Whiterose to
get us out of prison.

524
00:37:27,382 --> 00:37:29,482
The release... that was you.

525
00:37:29,518 --> 00:37:30,984
You somehow communicated with them.

526
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,552
It's what you wanted.

527
00:37:32,588 --> 00:37:34,188
You said to Darlene before
we started this thing

528
00:37:34,223 --> 00:37:35,222
that we had to go all the way.

529
00:37:35,257 --> 00:37:36,690
It was all part of the plan.

530
00:37:36,726 --> 00:37:38,358
Otherwise, what was the
point of the hack?

531
00:37:38,393 --> 00:37:41,828
If we were going to do this,
we had to go all the way.

532
00:37:41,863 --> 00:37:43,395
And that, Elliot, is what I want.

533
00:37:43,431 --> 00:37:45,331
It's what you asked me here for.

534
00:37:45,366 --> 00:37:47,734
Then tell me, what is that, exactly?

535
00:37:47,769 --> 00:37:49,568
What is "all the way"?

536
00:37:49,604 --> 00:37:51,537
This is where we get into trouble.

537
00:37:51,572 --> 00:37:53,873
You're meant to know only
as much as you can handle.

538
00:37:53,908 --> 00:37:55,541
When you wander outside of your realm

539
00:37:55,576 --> 00:37:57,777
is when we end up fighting.

540
00:38:03,683 --> 00:38:05,516
Are you...

541
00:38:05,552 --> 00:38:07,585
you distracting me right now?

542
00:38:15,762 --> 00:38:18,595
What are you doing?

543
00:38:18,631 --> 00:38:20,998
I'm hacking the firmware
like we discussed.

544
00:38:21,033 --> 00:38:25,202
We didn't discuss shit.

545
00:38:25,238 --> 00:38:26,703
We're not hacking anything.

546
00:38:26,739 --> 00:38:29,439
This will level that
building and kill people.

547
00:38:29,475 --> 00:38:31,275
Elliot, you need to leave
that computer alone.

548
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:33,009
- I'm confused.
- It's over.

549
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:34,410
I'm deleting the malware.

550
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:35,845
Elliot, I wouldn't do that.

551
00:38:35,881 --> 00:38:37,213
You can't delete that.

552
00:38:37,249 --> 00:38:38,748
Not only am I gonna delete it,

553
00:38:38,784 --> 00:38:40,283
I'm gonna get rid of the backdoor.

554
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,518
You do that, and everything
we worked for is gone.

555
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:44,020
Elliot, I am warning you...

556
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:45,255
This isn't what I want.

557
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:46,722
I want it shut down.

558
00:38:46,758 --> 00:38:49,025
But this was your idea.

559
00:38:55,565 --> 00:38:57,132
Leave the computer alone!

560
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,466
He's not gonna let you do this.

561
00:38:58,502 --> 00:38:59,835
Trust me.

562
00:39:23,659 --> 00:39:25,591
I don't know what's gotten into you.

563
00:39:25,627 --> 00:39:27,760
We're supposed to be gods together,

564
00:39:27,796 --> 00:39:30,430
and yet you want to destroy our destiny?

565
00:39:30,465 --> 00:39:33,967
You're not making sense.

566
00:39:34,002 --> 00:39:35,902
Elliot, listen to him.

567
00:39:35,938 --> 00:39:37,337
Walk away from the computer.

568
00:39:49,183 --> 00:39:51,283
You're the same.

569
00:39:52,954 --> 00:39:55,154
What the fuck
are you talking about?

570
00:39:55,189 --> 00:39:57,022
We are definitely not the same!

571
00:39:57,058 --> 00:39:58,990
Back away from the computer.

572
00:40:03,129 --> 00:40:09,033
<i>This is just another of Mr.
Robot's mind tricks.</i>

573
00:40:09,069 --> 00:40:10,668
No.

574
00:40:10,703 --> 00:40:13,371
Elliot...

575
00:40:13,406 --> 00:40:15,973
I don't want to shoot you, but I will.

576
00:40:16,008 --> 00:40:19,209
Elliot, listen to him.

577
00:40:19,245 --> 00:40:22,645
He's not holding a gun.

578
00:40:22,681 --> 00:40:24,314
He's not even there.

579
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:26,516
Elliot, you need to listen to him

580
00:40:26,551 --> 00:40:29,652
and step away from the computer!

581
00:40:29,688 --> 00:40:31,788
Touch that keyboard,
and I will shoot you.

582
00:40:34,525 --> 00:40:36,359
No.

583
00:40:40,831 --> 00:40:43,132
He won't.

584
00:40:43,167 --> 00:40:44,733
He can't.

585
00:40:47,939 --> 00:40:50,005
He doesn't exist.

586
00:40:52,742 --> 00:40:55,810
I'm the only one that exists.

587
00:41:00,918 --> 00:41:05,153
It's time to finally take back control.

588
00:41:12,895 --> 00:41:15,429
Real control.

589
00:41:45,159 --> 00:41:47,259
Ah...

590
00:42:17,356 --> 00:42:19,422
You know, when you gave me this,

591
00:42:19,458 --> 00:42:23,059
you said to stop anyone who
gets in the way of our plan.

592
00:42:23,095 --> 00:42:27,497
I didn't know what you meant,
but now it's very clear.

593
00:42:27,532 --> 00:42:31,233
You did this to yourself, Elliot.

594
00:42:31,268 --> 00:42:35,104
You asked earlier what "all the way" is.

595
00:42:35,139 --> 00:42:37,939
This is it.

596
00:42:37,975 --> 00:42:40,142
Sorry, kiddo.

597
00:42:40,177 --> 00:42:43,578
I couldn't
let anyone stop this...

598
00:42:43,614 --> 00:42:45,947
including us.

599
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:56,668
<i>Thanks for staying with us, Codyites.</i>

600
00:42:57,731 --> 00:43:00,365
<i>There's a lot to get to tonight.</i>

601
00:43:02,252 --> 00:43:04,852
<i>Look, all we do here is...</i>

602
00:43:04,887 --> 00:43:07,554
<i>is we try and bring you the truth.</i>

603
00:43:09,283 --> 00:43:11,150
<i>And they're trying to take that away.</i>

604
00:43:11,193 --> 00:43:13,093
<i>They
tried to take it away.</i>

605
00:43:13,129 --> 00:43:15,095
<i>Some of you might notice your
lights flickering tonight.</i>

606
00:43:15,131 --> 00:43:16,730
<i>Now, the fa...</i>

607
00:43:19,768 --> 00:43:22,769
Hello?

608
00:43:22,804 --> 00:43:25,972
Don't worry. It's Angela.

609
00:43:26,007 --> 00:43:28,440
Tyrell?

610
00:43:28,476 --> 00:43:30,977
Tyrell, are you there?

611
00:43:31,012 --> 00:43:32,979
It's okay.

612
00:43:33,014 --> 00:43:34,580
They told me you would be calling.

613
00:43:34,615 --> 00:43:37,315
This is a secure line.

614
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:40,285
Are you with Elliot right now?

615
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,452
<i>Yes.</i>

616
00:43:41,488 --> 00:43:43,088
Okay, I'm on my way.

617
00:43:43,123 --> 00:43:44,790
Don't let anyone near him.

618
00:43:44,825 --> 00:43:48,960
I should be the first person
he sees when he wakes up.

619
00:43:48,996 --> 00:43:51,529
<i>Okay.</i>

620
00:43:51,564 --> 00:43:55,266
Tyrell, you did what needed to be done.

621
00:43:55,301 --> 00:43:57,668
<i>I love him.</i>

622
00:43:59,505 --> 00:44:01,738
I do too.

623
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:54,255
♪
Both of us lonely ♪

624
00:45:24,396 --> 00:45:27,030
Have you given any more
thought to what I said?

625
00:45:27,055 --> 00:45:30,091
I don't want to discuss this.

626
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:32,420
- Mobley...
- Fredrick.

627
00:45:34,624 --> 00:45:37,657
Seriously, Fredrick,

628
00:45:37,692 --> 00:45:40,126
what if we could?

629
00:45:40,161 --> 00:45:42,094
This might work.

630
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:44,397
And also, it might not.

631
00:45:44,433 --> 00:45:47,266
I've taken enough risks
for one lifetime.

632
00:45:47,302 --> 00:45:49,903
I don't want to discuss it anymore.

633
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,673
But what if we could
generate the keys...

634
00:45:54,708 --> 00:45:57,743
Tanya...

635
00:45:57,778 --> 00:46:01,947
Will you just please shut up?

636
00:46:01,982 --> 00:46:03,749
What? This is important.

637
00:46:03,784 --> 00:46:06,184
- We need to talk about it.
- Change the subject.

638
00:46:06,219 --> 00:46:09,454
I don't want to change the subject.

639
00:46:09,489 --> 00:46:12,289
I miss my family.

640
00:46:12,325 --> 00:46:13,858
I don't want to live here.

641
00:46:13,893 --> 00:46:15,827
Oh, come on, it's nice out here.

642
00:46:15,862 --> 00:46:18,496
You know, uh... look,
no more bad winters.

643
00:46:18,531 --> 00:46:21,966
Hardly rains. That's great.

644
00:46:22,001 --> 00:46:24,168
I hate your friend. He's a dick.

645
00:46:24,203 --> 00:46:25,937
No, I-I told you.

646
00:46:25,972 --> 00:46:27,871
He did not know you
were in the bathroom.

647
00:46:27,906 --> 00:46:31,341
Trust me, he knew exactly
what he was doing.

648
00:46:31,376 --> 00:46:33,109
Weirdo. Save up enough money,

649
00:46:33,144 --> 00:46:35,211
and you'll be able to get
your own place eventually.

650
00:46:35,246 --> 00:46:36,680
Okay? Apartments here are dirt cheap.

651
00:46:36,715 --> 00:46:38,849
Won't be that long.

652
00:46:38,884 --> 00:46:42,185
Just be thankful he was
able to get us this job.

653
00:46:45,590 --> 00:46:47,155
Hey, what flavor did you get again?

654
00:46:47,191 --> 00:46:50,025
You want to trade?

655
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:52,928
Please, just look at it.

656
00:46:55,032 --> 00:46:57,900
Okay, so... so what? Say I did.

657
00:46:57,935 --> 00:47:00,402
Then what?

658
00:47:00,437 --> 00:47:03,705
If what I discovered is real,
do you know what that means?

659
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:06,975
Yeah, I know exactly what it means.

660
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:08,409
Yeah. It means we could

661
00:47:08,444 --> 00:47:10,879
potentially undo this whole thing.

662
00:47:10,914 --> 00:47:13,715
Put everything back the way it was.

663
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:17,051
I know. I know.

664
00:47:17,086 --> 00:47:19,586
Please.

665
00:47:19,622 --> 00:47:20,988
Just look at what I found.

666
00:47:21,023 --> 00:47:22,422
Excuse me.

667
00:47:22,457 --> 00:47:24,725
Oh, sorry, dude. We're on a break.

668
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:27,895
Yeah, I just had a quick question.

669
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:32,065
Do you have the time?

670
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:37,403
