Because you're an idiot,

is not the sensational
aspects of the crime itself,

00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:37,459
And I bet she'd love you lot.

862

It's all right, everyone,
I can personally assure you

863
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:42,179
that Sherlock Holmes is not
about to arrest the Queen.

864
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:45,299
Well, of course not. Not Her Majesty.

865
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:52,419
Money, power, fame, some
hings make you untouchable.

866
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:53,699
God save the Queen!

867
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,659
She could open a slaughterhouse

868
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:57,619
and we'd all probably pay the entrance fee.

869
00:46:57,620 --> 00:47:00,660
- No-one's untouchable.
- No-one?

870
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:08,799
Look at you all, so gloomy.
Can't you take a joke?

871
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:11,779
The Queen!

872
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:16,499
If the Queen was a serial killer,
I'd be the first person she'd tell.

873
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,179
We have that kind of friendship.

Thank you so much for coming. Thank you.

No, let's go in here.

880
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:43,659
So you've had another one
of your little meetings?

881
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:46,139
Oh, it's just a monthly top-up.

882
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:50,339
Confession is good for the soul,
providing you can delete it.

00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:51,379
What's TD 12?

884
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:53,139
It's a memory inhibitor.

885
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:54,819
Bliss.

886
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:56,339
Bliss?

887
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:59,859
Opt-in ignorance.
It makes the world go round.

888
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:01,739
Anyone ever opt to remember?

889
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:04,019
Some people take the drip out, yes.

890
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:06,419
Some people have the same urges.

891
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:08,419
Now, come on, wasting time.

892
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:11,140
Indeed, you have,
I estimate, 20 minutes left.

893
00:48:12,571 --> 00:48:13,508
Sorry?

894
00:48:13,533 --> 00:48:14,730
I sent a text from
your phone, remember?

895
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:16,299
It was read almost immediately.

shock and emotional decision,

and a journey time based
on the associated address,

898
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:24,579
I'd say that your life, as you know it,
has 20 minutes left to run.

899
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:27,019
Well, no, 17½ to be precise,

900
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:28,499

Do you know what he did?

you want to hide a pebble.

There are two possible explanations
for what's going on here.

01:14:56,580 --> 01:14:57,979
There's loads more.

1377
01:14:57,980 --> 01:14:59,699
Tomorrow.

1378
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:03,179
You know, I am going to be so famous now.

1379
01:15:03,180 --> 01:15:04,979
You're already famous.

1380
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:07,180
Yeah, but with this...

1381
01:15:08,860 --> 01:15:10,460
...I can break America.

1382
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:17,459
I had, of course,
several other backup plans.

1383
01:15:17,460 --> 01:15:20,219
Trouble is, I couldn't
remember what they were.

1384
01:15:20,220 --> 01:15:23,019
And, of course, I hadn't really anticipated

1385
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:25,699
that I'd hallucinated meeting his daughter.

1386
01:15:25,700 --> 01:15:28,419
Basically, he trashed himself
on drugs so that you'd help him,

1387
01:15:28,420 --> 01:15:30,619
so that you'd have something to do,
something doctory.

1388
01:15:30,620 --> 01:15:31,899
You get that now?

1389
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:34,099
Still a bit troubled by the daughter.

1390
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:35,819
It did seem very real.

1391
01:15:35,820 --> 01:15:38,739
She gave me information I
couldn't have acquired elsewhere.

1392
01:15:38,740 --> 01:15:40,819
But she wasn't ever here?

1393
01:15:40,820 --> 01:15:42,059
Interesting, isn't it?

1394
01:15:42,060 --> 01:15:44,379
I have theorised before that
if one could attenuate to

1395
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:46,699
every available data stream
in the world simultaneously,

1396
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:49,940
it would be possible to anticipate
and deduce almost anything.

1397
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:52,859
Hmm.

1398
01:15:52,860 --> 01:15:55,939
So, you dreamed up a magic woman
who told you things you didn't know?

1399
01:15:55,940 --> 01:15:59,739
Well, sounds about right to me.
Possibly, I'm biased.

1400
01:15:59,740 --> 01:16:03,580
Perhaps the drugs opened
certain doors in my mind.

1401
01:16:06,255 --> 01:16:08,175
- I'm intrigued.
- I know you are.

1402
01:16:09,060 --> 01:16:12,219
Which is why we're all taking it in
turns to keep you off the sweeties.

1403
01:16:12,220 --> 01:16:13,940
I thought we were just hanging out.

1404
01:16:16,980 --> 01:16:18,659
Molly will be here in 20 minutes.

1405
01:16:18,660 --> 01:16:22,100
Oh, I do think I can last 20
minutes without supervision.

1406
01:16:24,220 --> 01:16:26,259
Well, if you're sure.

1407
01:16:26,260 --> 01:16:28,140
Christ, John, stay, talk!

1408
01:16:29,580 --> 01:16:32,339
Uh, sorry, it's just, um, you know, Rosie.

1409
01:16:32,340 --> 01:16:33,899
Yes, of course, Rosie.

1410
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:37,019
Go and solve a crime together,
make him wear the hat.

1411
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:39,659
- You'll be OK for 20 minutes?
- Yes, yes.

1412
01:16:39,660 --> 01:16:42,299
- Sorry, I... I wasn't thinking of Rosie.
- No problem.

1413
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:44,940
I should, er, come and see her soon.

1414
01:16:46,460 --> 01:16:49,179
Yes. Actually, he should wear the
hat as a special tribute to me.

1415
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:51,659
I'm dead, I would really appreciate it.

1416
01:16:51,660 --> 01:16:54,819
Oh, by the way, the recordings
will probably be inadmissible.

1417
01:16:54,820 --> 01:16:56,859
- Sorry, what?
- Well, technically, it's entrapment,

1418
01:16:56,860 --> 01:16:58,739
so it might get thrown out as evidence.

1419
01:16:58,740 --> 01:17:01,699
Not that that matters.
Apparently he can't stop confessing.

1420
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:03,340
- That's good.
- Yeah.

1421
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:12,339
- Are you OK?
- [JOHN LAUGHS]

1422
01:17:12,340 --> 01:17:14,019
What, am I...? No, no, I'm not OK.

1423
01:17:14,020 --> 01:17:15,819
I'm never going to be OK.

1424
01:17:15,820 --> 01:17:18,059
And we'll just have to accept that.

1425
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:19,339
It is what it is,

1426
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:21,939
and what it is is... shit.

1427
01:17:21,940 --> 01:17:22,980
John, do better.

1428
01:17:26,420 --> 01:17:29,899
You didn't kill Mary.
Mary died saving your life.

1429
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:31,819
It was her choice, no-one made her do it.

1430
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:33,459
No-one could ever make her do anything.

1431
01:17:33,460 --> 01:17:35,709
The point is, you did not kill her.

1432
01:17:38,180 --> 01:17:40,780
In saving my life,
she conferred a value on it.

1433
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:45,420
It is a currency I do
not know how to spend.

1434
01:17:49,780 --> 01:17:51,380
It is what it is.

1435
01:17:55,220 --> 01:17:57,419
I'm tomorrow, six till ten.
I'll see you then.

1436
01:17:57,420 --> 01:18:01,059
- Looking forward to it.
- Yeah.

[WOMAN GROANS]

1438
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:06,659
That noise, that's a text alert noise?

1439
01:18:06,660 --> 01:18:07,820
What was that?

1440
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:11,059
Hmm? What was what?

1441
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:12,859
That's the text alert of Irene Adler.

1442
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:14,419
She's the scary mad one, right?

1443
01:18:14,420 --> 01:18:17,019
- That noise?
- What noise?

1444
01:18:17,020 --> 01:18:18,299
But she's dead.

Oh, my God!

Oh, the posh boy loves the dominatrix.

1449
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:30,179
He's never knowingly under-cliched, is he?

John?

1451
01:18:32,020 --> 01:18:34,779
- I'm going to make a deduction.
- Oh, OK, that's good.

1452
01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:36,259
And if my deduction is right,

1453
01:18:36,260 --> 01:18:38,539
you're going to be
honest and tell me, OK?

1454
01:18:38,564 --> 01:18:39,299
OK.

possible for any given text alert

Thank you, John, that's...
very kind of you.

Well, now you do.

Do you go to a discreet

She's out there,
she likes you and she's alive!

1470

And do you have the first idea

1471
01:19:19,220 --> 01:19:20,579
how lucky you are?!

1472
01:19:20,580 --> 01:19:24,779
Yes, she's a lunatic, she's a criminal,
she's insanely dangerous.

Trust you to fall for a sociopath!
Oh, married an assassin!

- What?
- Just text

1476
01:19:31,705 --> 01:19:32,900
- her back.
- Why?

1477
01:19:32,900 --> 01:19:34,619
Because High Wycombe is better than

01:19:34,620 --> 01:19:37,339
you are currently equipped to understand!

01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:39,579
I once caught a triple
poisoner in High Wycombe.

That's only the beginning, mate.

01:19:46,660 --> 01:19:49,379
- Would complete you as a human being.
- That doesn't even mean anything.

1484
01:19:49,380 --> 01:19:50,579
Just text her, phone her,

1485
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:52,339
do something while
there's still a chance,

1486
01:19:52,340 --> 01:19:54,099
because that chance doesn't last forever.

1487
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:56,379
Trust me, Sherlock,
it's gone before you know it.

1488

1489
01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:06,659
She was wrong about me.

01:20:06,660 --> 01:20:07,700
Mary? How so?

1491
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:12,339
She thought that if you
put yourself in harm's way,

1492
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:15,339
I'd... I'd rescue you, or something.

1493
01:20:15,340 --> 01:20:17,500
But I didn't, not till she told me to.

1494
01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:21,019
And that's how this works,
that's what you're missing.

1495
01:20:21,020 --> 01:20:23,539
She taught me to be the man
she already thought I was.

1496
01:20:23,540 --> 01:20:24,899
Get yourself a piece of that.

1497
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:27,019
Forgive me, but you are
doing yourself a disservice.

1498
01:20:27,020 --> 01:20:29,499
I have known many people in this world,
but made few friends,

1499
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:31,580
and I can safely say... I cheated on her.

1500
01:20:35,060 --> 01:20:36,339
No clever comeback?

1501
01:20:36,340 --> 01:20:37,660
I cheated on you, Mary.

1502
01:20:40,140 --> 01:20:41,899
There was a woman on the bus,

1503
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:43,899
and I had a plastic daisy in my hair,

1504
01:20:43,900 --> 01:20:45,380
I'd been playing with Rosie.

1505
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:49,780
And this girl just smiled at me.

1506
01:20:51,326 --> 01:20:52,966
That's all it was, it was a smile.

1507
01:20:54,260 --> 01:20:56,139
We texted, constantly.

1508
01:20:56,140 --> 01:20:57,299
You want to know when?

1509
01:20:57,300 --> 01:20:59,339
Every time you left the room, that's when.

1510
01:20:59,340 --> 01:21:01,139
When you were feeding our daughter.

1511
01:21:01,140 --> 01:21:03,980
When you were stopping her
from crying, that's when.

1512
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:09,700
And that's all it was.

1513
01:21:10,780 --> 01:21:12,300
Just texting.

1514
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:14,700
But I wanted more.

1515
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:19,020
And do you know something? I still do.

1516
01:21:20,300 --> 01:21:22,859
I'm not the man you thought I was,
I'm not that guy.

1517

Well, it's your birthday.
Cake is obligatory.

1531
01:22:38,060 --> 01:22:41,299
Oh, well, I suppose a sugar
high is some sort of substitute.

1532
01:22:41,300 --> 01:22:42,699
Behave.

1533
01:22:42,700 --> 01:22:45,539
Right then.
You know, it's not my place to say,

1534
01:22:45,540 --> 01:22:48,420
but... it was just texting.

01:22:50,060 --> 01:22:54,819
People text. Even I text.
Her, I mean. Woman. Bad idea.

1536
01:22:54,820 --> 01:22:56,900
Try not to, but, you know, sometimes...

01:22:58,300 --> 01:23:00,299
It's not a pleasant thought, John,

1538
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:02,619

feeling from time to time

1539
01:23:02,620 --> 01:23:05,019
that we might all just be human.

- No.

01:23:18,620 --> 01:23:19,660
What's wrong?

1545
01:23:21,940 --> 01:23:23,779
[JOHN LAUGHS] Seriously?

1546
01:23:23,780 --> 01:23:25,580
I'm Sherlock Holmes, I wear the damn hat!

1547
01:23:28,620 --> 01:23:30,060
Isn't that right, Mary?

1548
01:23:40,340 --> 01:23:43,019
You seem so much better, John.

1549
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:46,179
Yeah, I... I am. I think I am.

1550
01:23:46,180 --> 01:23:49,699
Not all day, not every
day, but, you know.

1551
01:23:49,700 --> 01:23:51,883
- It is what it is?
- Yeah.

1552
01:23:53,620 --> 01:23:54,939
And Rosie?

1553
01:23:54,940 --> 01:23:56,419
Beautiful, perfect.

1554
01:23:56,420 --> 01:23:59,699
Unprecedented in the history of children.

1555
01:23:59,700 --> 01:24:02,579
That's not my bias,
that's scientific fact.

1556
01:24:02,580 --> 01:24:05,459
- Good. And Sherlock Holmes?
- Back to normal.

1557
01:24:05,460 --> 01:24:06,619
'Get out!'

1558
01:24:06,620 --> 01:24:07,939
She's possessed by the devil!

1559
01:24:07,940 --> 01:24:09,939
I swear, my wife is channelling Satan!

1560
01:24:09,940 --> 01:24:11,659
Yes, boring, go away!

1561
01:24:11,660 --> 01:24:13,499
I'm not channelling Satan!

1562
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:15,620
Why not, given your
immediately alternative?

1563
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:27,339
- What about his brother?
- Mycroft? He's fine.

1564
01:24:27,340 --> 01:24:31,139
So, you're off now.
I won't see you for a week?

1565
01:24:31,140 --> 01:24:35,380
Just spending it at home.
Unless she calls. The PM.

1566
01:24:37,340 --> 01:24:39,379
Here. What's this?

1567
01:24:39,380 --> 01:24:41,939
- My number.
- I already have your number.

1568
01:24:41,940 --> 01:24:44,659
- My private number.
- Why would I need that?

1569
01:24:44,660 --> 01:24:48,099
I don't know. Maybe
you'd like a drink sometime.

1570
01:24:48,100 --> 01:24:52,099
- Of... what?
- Up to you.

1571
01:24:52,100 --> 01:24:53,780
Call me.

1572
01:24:57,540 --> 01:24:59,660
[HE CHUCKLES]

1573
01:25:05,540 --> 01:25:08,019
I mean, obviously, "normal" and "fine"

1574
01:25:08,020 --> 01:25:10,699
are both relative terms when it
comes to Sherlock and Mycroft.

1575
01:25:10,700 --> 01:25:12,540
Obviously.

1576
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:22,700
She was real.

1577
01:25:29,740 --> 01:25:31,699
'But I didn't mean Mycroft.'

1578
01:25:31,700 --> 01:25:33,899
I meant the other one.

1579
01:25:33,900 --> 01:25:36,819
Which other one? You know, the secret one.

1580
01:25:36,820 --> 01:25:39,539
Oh, that was just something I said.

1581
01:25:39,540 --> 01:25:40,700
I'm sure there's...

1582
01:25:44,700 --> 01:25:47,059
How did you know about that?
I didn't tell you that.

1583
01:25:47,060 --> 01:25:49,219
- You must have done.
- I really didn't.

1584
01:25:49,220 --> 01:25:51,939
Well, maybe Sherlock told me.

1585
01:25:51,940 --> 01:25:55,939
But you've met Sherlock
exactly once, in this room,

1586
01:25:55,940 --> 01:25:57,259
he was off his head.

1587
01:25:57,260 --> 01:26:00,179
Oh, no, no, I met him before that.

1588
01:26:00,180 --> 01:26:01,499
When?

1589
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:05,419
We spent a night together. It was lovely.

1590
01:26:05,420 --> 01:26:07,220
We had chips.

1591
01:26:13,060 --> 01:26:15,900
IN NORTHERN ACCENT:
"You're not what I expected, Mr Holmes."

1592
01:26:16,980 --> 01:26:20,683
"You're... nicer."

1593
01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:35,579
Culverton gave me Faith's original note.

1594
01:26:35,580 --> 01:26:38,257
A mutual friend put us in touch.

1595
01:26:39,140 --> 01:26:42,539
Did Sherlock ever
tell you about the note?

1596
01:26:42,540 --> 01:26:45,219
I added some deductions for Sherlock.

1597
01:26:45,220 --> 01:26:47,678
He was quite good.

1598
01:26:48,860 --> 01:26:52,365
But... he didn't get the big one.

1599
01:26:55,195 --> 01:26:58,451
_

1600
01:27:04,340 --> 01:27:08,699
In fairness, though, he does
have excellent taste in chips.

1601
01:27:08,700 --> 01:27:10,259
- What's that?
- What's what?

1602
01:27:10,260 --> 01:27:12,259
The flower in your hair,
it's like I had on the bus.

1603
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:14,859
You looked very sweet.

1604
01:27:14,860 --> 01:27:16,100
But then...

1605
01:27:18,740 --> 01:27:21,539
"You have such nice eyes."

1606
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:24,859
Amazing the times a man doesn't
really look at your face.

1607
01:27:24,860 --> 01:27:29,299
Oh, you can hide behind a
sexy smile or a walking cane,

1608
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:31,419
or just be a therapist,

1609
01:27:31,420 --> 01:27:35,939
talking about you... all the time.

1610
01:27:35,940 --> 01:27:37,459
Oh, please don't go anywhere,

1611
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:39,459
I'm sure the therapist
who actually lives here

1612
01:27:39,460 --> 01:27:40,979
wouldn't want blood on the carpet.

1613
01:27:40,980 --> 01:27:43,019
Oh, hang on, it's fine.

1614
01:27:43,020 --> 01:27:44,779
She's in a sack in the airing cupboard.

1615
01:27:44,780 --> 01:27:46,980
- Who are you?
- Isn't it obvious?

1616
01:27:49,460 --> 01:27:51,179
Haven't you guessed?

1617
01:27:51,180 --> 01:27:52,579
I'm Eurus.

1618
01:27:52,580 --> 01:27:54,019
Eurus?

1619
01:27:54,020 --> 01:27:58,619
Silly name, isn't it? Greek.
Means "the east wind".

1620
01:27:58,620 --> 01:28:00,859
My parents loved silly names,

1621
01:28:00,860 --> 01:28:03,379
like Eurus...

1622
01:28:03,380 --> 01:28:05,619
or Mycroft...

1623
01:28:05,620 --> 01:28:07,666
or Sherlock.

1624
01:28:07,691 --> 01:28:09,459
Oh, look at him.

1625
01:28:09,460 --> 01:28:11,619
Didn't it ever occur
to you, not even once,

1626
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:15,700
that Sherlock's secret brother might
just be Sherlock's secret sister?

1627
01:28:17,380 --> 01:28:18,580
Huh?

1628
01:28:19,700 --> 01:28:21,620
He's making a funny face.

1629
01:28:23,700 --> 01:28:25,300
I think I'll put a hole in it.
